"1","Article 1","Everyone knows Utah is a conservative bastion whose residents deny climate science, right? Well, perhaps not.Fully 71 percent of Utahns say climate change is real, according to a recent poll commissioned by The Salt Lake Tribune and the University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute of Politics. A slightly lower percentage — 64 percent — believe climate change is exacerbated by human activity, and even that number represents a solid majority.Because the questions and methodologies behind the latest poll differ from previous surveys on the topic, it’s difficult to say whether belief in climate change is a growing trend in Utah. But Peter Howe, an assistant professor of geography at Utah State University who studies attitudes toward climate change, said he was surprised by the results, which differ notably from other polls and from national perceptions of Utah.“Because Utah is such a red state — and because political orientation is so associated with climate opinion — we would assume Utah would lead” the nation in climate skepticism, Howe said. “But it appears, Utah may be somewhat of an anomaly, though I think that we need more data to say that conclusively.”The Yale Climate Opinion Map, a public-opinion project to which Howe contributes, found that 62 percent of Utahns believe climate change is happening, compared to a nationwide average of 70 percent. Beehive State residents were also significantly less likely to believe that global warming was caused mostly by human activities, at 43 percent.Those numbers, according to the Yale map project, would place Utah among states whose residents are the least-likely Americans to believe in human-caused climate change. Only Wyoming has a lower percentage of residents who say they believe human activity is the major contributor to global warming.However, the Yale map also found that Utahns strongly support political action to curb climate change, Howe said, a key indicator that Utah might differ from other states leaning to the nation’s political right.According to the Yale polling, 79 percent of Utahns support government funding for renewable-energy research, and 67 percent said the government should regulate carbon dioxide — thought by a majority of scientists globally to be a key contributor to global warming — as a pollutant.Utah politicians, many of whom have a track record of fighting regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions, may want to take note of that finding, Howe said.Some state leaders do appear to be turning over a new leaf on climate change. While heralding the completion of the state’s 50-year water plan earlier this year, Utah Gov. Gary Herbert acknowledged that the state has “swings in climate,” though what exactly that revealed about his attitude on climate change is ambiguous.“We have had drought in the past, and we will have drought in the future,” Herbert said during the water plan ceremony. “We need to anticipate what that’s going to be like in a fast-growing state.”The water plan itself devotes an entire chapter to addressing climate change in Utah, though some of Herbert’s advisers involved in drafting the plan said discussion on the topic was contentious.Utah’s elected leaders in Congress, all Republicans, have made similar statements.“I agree with the majority of Utahns in this [Tribune-Hinckley] poll,” 2nd District Rep. Chris Stewart, said in a statement to The Tribune. “Climate change is happening now, it’s happened in the past, and it will continue to happen in the future.”Sen. Mike Lee — who in June joined 21 other Republican U.S. senators in urging President Donald Trump to withdraw from the Paris climate accord — offered similar sentiments.“Climate change is real,” Lee said in a statement to The Tribune. “The climate is constantly changing. To what degree human activity is causing it, I don’t know, but I have yet to hear a single proposal that would solve the problem but not devastate our economy.”Fourth District Rep. Mia Love is a member of the House Climate Solutions Caucus, which seeks “economically viable and broadly supported solutions to measured changes” in the world’s climate. Love has challenged the notion that Americans must choose between a thriving economy and combating climate change.“Our toxic political climate threatens our ability to effectively address our physical climate,” she wrote in an op-ed earlier this year.All Americans, Love added in a statement to The Tribune, have a role to play in protecting the environment.“It’s our responsibility to do everything we can to make sure that our children are not just inheriting an economically viable country,” Love said, “but an environmentally viable one.”So which of these views most closely matches those of the Utah voting public? That may depend on which set of polls you believe.Howe noted that the Yale Climate Opinion Map is based on figures from 2016, opening the possibility that the more recent Tribune-Hinckley poll — conducted Oct. 10 to 13 — may signal that Utahns, like other U.S. residents, are becoming increasingly convinced of climate change as time goes on.But the Tribune-Hinckley poll also found only 8 percent of respondents in Utah said their opinion about global warming had changed after this summer’s hurricanes, wildfires and other weather-related events.Fifty-six percent of respondents said they already believed the climate was changing before those extreme weather events, while 32 percent said the events had not changed their disbelief in climate change.Howe noted that the Tribune-Hinckley poll reached 605 registered voters in Utah, while the national Yale Climate Opinion Map polling contacted fewer Utahns.That, he said, could bolster the theory that although Utah remains a GOP stronghold, the views of large numbers of its residents have begun to diverge from those of their national conservative counterparts. It’s generally known, for example, that Utahns’ attitudes toward immigration differ from other Republicans; perhaps they have begun to see climate change differently, too, Howe said.Beyond that, Howe said climate opinions captured by the Tribune-Hinckley poll largely mirror other national trends. For example, 43 percent of Utahns who described themselves as “very conservative” believed climate change is real, compared to 84 percent of self-described moderate Utahns and 96 percent of those who say they are liberal.“That’s completely consistent with what we have seen,” the USU scholar said. “Climate change has become polarized over the past couple of decades…. Why that is is likely due to a combination of factors.”Similarly, Utahns with more formal education were also more likely to believe in climate change — up to a point. While 70 percent of Utahns with a bachelor’s degree said they believed climate change was real, only 65 percent of Utahns with post-graduate education said the same. The Tribune-Hinckley poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.98 percentage points.The education numbers are also consistent with national data, which Howe said indicate that people at both ends of the educational spectrum are more likely to dismiss climate change than those in the middle.The Tribune-Hinckley poll also found that more active members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints were less likely to express a belief in climate change. Fully 63 percent of Mormon respondents describing themselves as “very active” said they believed in climate change, compared to 87 percent of Catholics and 83 percent of Protestants, the poll found.Howe said this is probably because LDS Church involvement and political ideology are also correlated; however, he said, sociologists are still studying the impact of religion on climate-change attitudes."
"2","Article 2","Draft rules on restricting tailpipe greenhouse gases in Arizona are nearly ready, though it could be a case of hurry up and wait.The state's rules will mirror California's and are expected to be in final form sometime this spring. But Arizona's planned automotive-emissions rules won't be implemented any time soon. They're tied to California receiving approval for its own rules from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.And that's not happening. EPA administrator Stephen Johnson announced Dec. 19 the agency was denying a waiver California had requested two years ago.Just the same, Arizona will move ahead with its own rules to cut greenhouse gases in cars and trucks, said Steven Owens, director of the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality.""There's been a bump in the road, but it was not unexpected,"" Owens said Dec. 20.The ""clean-car"" rules are included in recommendations made by a climate-change advisory group created by Gov. Janet Napolitano.Arizona isn't the only state seeking to cut automotive greenhouse gas emissions. Sixteen others have adopted or plan to adopt California standards.The EPA's decision comes down on the side of automakers, who have sued to block regulation of greenhouse gases in cars.EPA administrator Johnson told reporters a national solution is needed to greenhouse gases and global warming, ""not a confusing patchwork of state rules. ""But Owens said the rules - favored by more than a dozen states - would not be a patchwork.""We would all be adopting the California standards. It's not like you have 50 different vehicle emissions standards,"" Owens said.A spokesman for an automakers group earlier said the reality is more complicated, because the standards cover all vehicles - lumping cars and light trucks together. But trucks are generally less fuel-efficient than cars, said Wade Newton, spokesman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers in Washington, D.C.More fuel-efficient vehicles produce less in the way of greenhouse gases. Fifty-six percent of the vehicles registered in Arizona are light trucks and 44 percent are cars, he said.""Passenger cars would have to get much higher mileage than in a state like California where it's 50-50,"" Newton said.It's an argument dismissed by Diane Brown, executive director of Arizona Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), a non-profit that advocates for consumer issues and the environment.""The technology is there for them to move forward instead of stalling,"" Brown said of automakers.Widespread support among states, she added, could ""lead to stronger standards federally. ""The California standards, Owens said, have not just spread to other states. They've gone international.""A number of Canadian provinces have said they're going to adopt the standards, and in fact, I think Quebec did,"" he said.And California itself had grown tired of waiting on the EPA. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger - acting on California's behalf - sued the EPA in November to force a decision. Arizona joined a dozen other states as interveners. The suit was filed in federal court in Washington, D.C.Another lawsuitCalifornia got its decision - one that likely will lead to another lawsuit, Owens said. Schwarzenegger made it clear his state would take legal action if EPA rejected the wavier.""I think it's a safe assumption that we'll be involved in litigation,"" Owens said, adding the decision would be up to Napolitano and Attorney General Terry Goddard.Other states will likely join in as well. Owens spoke to officials in other states following the decision. The reaction was across the board.""Every state is outraged, but not surprised by what the EPA has done,"" Owens said.Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA sets emissions standards for automobiles. States ordinarily can't set stricter standards. California is the exception.""California had vehicle-emission standards and other air-quality laws and standards long before the federal government enacted the Clean Air Act and even established the EPA. "" Owens said.But to go its own way, California first needs an EPA waiver. It's not a rare event. The EPA has granted some 50 waivers in 40 years, according to news reports. The Dec. 19 rejection was the first.Had California received the waiver, other states could have adopted the federal standards or California's. Arizona's rules would have to mirror California's, almost without exception.""We don't have any real flexibility from a technical perspective to change what California has done,"" Owens said.DEQ would have some authority, however, to determine when the rules should kick in. California's would apply to vehicles beginning with model year 2009. Arizona rules would apply to the model year 2011 and later.The proposed rules would mandate a 30-percent reduction in tailpipe greenhouse gases by 2020. In Arizona, automobiles contribute 40 percent of the total greenhouse-gas emissions, Owens said. Power plants that burn fossil fuels are another major source.Greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, have been linked to global warming.In refusing the waiver, Johnson said ""climate change effects everyone regardless of where greenhouse gases occur, so California is not exclusive. ""But Owen said that same argument failed to convince the U.S. Supreme Court. Earlier this year, the court ruled against the EPA for failing to regulate greenhouse gases.The court said that - as a global problem - ""you have to start somewhere,"" Owens said.  California and other states already regulate pollution that crosses state lines, he added.But reducing greenhouse gases in autos doesn't just fight global warming, Owens said. There's a side benefit.""In the long run, it's going to save the consumer a lot of money,"" he said.Cutting greenhouse gas emissions makes for better gas mileage.Better mileage! Less pollution!As it happens, the question about what the rules actually do - save gasoline or cut greenhouse gases - lies at the heart of lawsuits filed by Alliance of Automakers and other plaintiffs.""The only way to reduce the amount of greenhouse-gas emissions is to reduce the amount of fuel that an automobile burns,"" said Newton, the alliance spokesman.Automakers contend the new rules are actually fuel-efficiency standards, not air-quality standards. And fuel ratings fall under the purview of Congress.Newton pointed out that Congress just passed an energy bill calling for higher gas mileage. President Bush signed the bill into law Dec. 19.""We really feel that we have a 50-state plan,"" Newton said.EPA's Johnson cited the new energy law, saying it did away with the need for a separate emissions rule.Newton agreed. He said the law's requirement for better fuel-economy sets a less rigid timetable than California's rule - a timetable with which carmakers can reasonably comply.But Owens said the emissions standards and fuel economy are apples and oranges.""It's really an excuse the EPA came up with ... to drag this out as long as they can until this administration goes out of office,"" he said.Brown of PIRG added the clean-car rules speak directly to tailpipe emissions, she said.""The clean-cars program regulates how much pollution a fleet of cars can emit,"" Brown said. ""The program does not regulate fuel economy. ""While EPA bought into the argument - that limiting carbon dioxide is a matter of fuel-economy - it failed to convince two federal judges. Automakers lost lawsuits filed against California and Vermont. The alliance plans to appeal the Vermont decision. Whether to appeal the California case - which the judge dismissed - hasn't been decided, Newton said. A similar lawsuit is pending against Rhode Island. In Arizona, after DEQ officials complete the draft rules, the public will have 30 days to comment.The next step is approval by the Governor's Regulatory Review Council. The final rules could be on the books by spring. But whether they go into effect could depend on the outcome of any more lawsuits against the EPA. Or, Owens said, on a change in administration in 2009."
"3","Article 3","Climate change is such a massive problem, with such potentially catastrophic ramifications, many people have trouble getting their heads around the danger we face.So let's put things in simpler terms.Climate change means you'll be paying more for coffee, every day, for possibly the rest of your life.And it may not taste as good.""U.S. consumers should expect much more expensive and lower-quality coffee because of rising temperatures, extreme rainfalls, and higher frequency of severe droughts,"" said Titus O. Awokuse, chairman of the department of agricultural, food and resource economics at Michigan State University.""Recent studies show that up to 60% of high-quality coffee species are at risk of extinction because of the negative impacts of climate change,"" he told me.There. Got your attention now?Climate change isn't just an environmental issue. It's a consumer issue.The cost of food is rising. That's partly due to supply and labor issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic.But it's also a reflection of how our planet's changing climate is affecting crops, livestock and other food sources.""Prices reflect supply and demand, and if production costs rise or supply becomes more constrained, prices will rise,"" said Carolyn Dimitri, an associate professor of nutrition and food studies at New York University.""Climate change is likely to increase production costs and reduce supply, at least in some years,"" she predicted, adding that she would be ""horrified"" if decent coffee became harder to come by.""I will pay just about any price for my coffee,"" Dimitri said, echoing my own thoughts and, I suspect, those of millions of other coffee drinkers.Coffee futures recently jumped to the highest level in four years, due in part to extreme weather in Brazil, the world's largest coffee producer.Factor in pandemic-related supply issues, and the cost of coffee beans has risen more than 40% so far this year.Because caffeine heavyweights such as Starbucks and Nestle buy their coffee supplies well in advance, not all dealers of our daily fix will be raising prices immediately.But some are already warning of higher retail costs.J.M. Smucker, maker of Folgers and Dunkin' ground coffee, said it has no choice but to jack up prices. ""We are seeing inflationary costs impacting the entire fiscal year,"" the company's chief financial officer said during a recent conference call.Coffee is just one item on supermarket shelves that's getting more expensive because of climate change.Harsh weather is driving up the cost of sugar. Wheat prices are now at the highest level in nearly eight years.Corn, soybeans, avocados, almonds, honey, citrus -- all are more expensive.And this isn't just in America. According to the United Nations, food prices worldwide were up by 33% in August from a year before.""Climate change is a contributor because climate variability, extreme events and sustained droughts in certain regions can reduce yields and hence supplies,"" said Sanford Eigenbrode, a professor of entomology at the University of Idaho.This isn't to say we're doomed. Some experts believe global food production will adjust to a changing climate.""Climate change will not affect agriculture the same way in all parts of the world,"" said Ellen Bruno, an agricultural economist at UC Berkeley. ""We have a lot of adaptive capacity.""In other words, crops that start failing in some parts of the world may thrive in others.Overall, however, climate change is reaching -- or has already reached, by some estimates -- a point of no return. And this all but guarantees higher food costs in the future.A recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world's leading authority on climate science, found that droughts that previously occurred perhaps once a decade are now 70% more frequent than in the preindustrial era.Climate change obviously poses a greater threat than just pricier meals. It means hotter temperatures, heavier rainfall, more droughts, rising sea levels, flooding of coastal areas and other dystopian prospects.Solutions for a problem of this scope aren't easy. Nations around the world are being called upon to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adopt more eco-friendly energy sources.These measures are challenging and expensive, and require both unity and sacrifice -- two things that aren't always easy in a world guided mostly by self-interest and short-sightedness.What you can do -- what you should do -- is support politicians who recognize the danger and who are prepared to rise above selfish interests and show necessary leadership during a time of global crisis.Also consider taking your business to companies that are willing to play a role in addressing climate change, although it's not always clear how serious some corporations are in this regard.Institutional Shareholder Services has found that just over a third of Standard & Poor's 500 companies have set ambitious climate change targets. The rest have modest goals or no climate change plans at all.Some tech and retail heavyweights, including Microsoft and Walmart, have been among the most aggressive in laying out plans to become ""carbon neutral"" in coming years.But others, especially those in the heavily polluting energy sector, have been cagier about their intentions or have resisted overhauling operations for the sake of planetary survival.As I said up top, this is tough stuff, requiring tough, sweeping solutions -- the sort of behavior that human beings historically have not shown themselves to be very good at.So keep the focus tight. If nothing else, think about the food you eat. Think about your daily coffee habit. Hell, think about my daily coffee habit.""People in the U.S. have enjoyed a long period where crop yields have increased and food prices have declined,"" said Dane Scott, a professor of environmental ethics at the University of Montana. ""That period is likely over.""He told me price hikes are now ""inevitable.""""Consumers should expect to pay more for food products to help finance the enormous undertaking of adapting agriculture to a changing climate,"" Scott said. ""The greater the disruption to the Earth's climate system, the greater the social and economic costs of adaptation.""And your grande, quad, nonfat, one-pump, no-whip mocha is no exception."
"4","Article 4","SALT LAKE CITY  ? A new report says the effects of climate change are already being felt in bug-infested forests of the Intermountain West, in reduced flows of the Colorado River basin and in the amount of snow that falls in the Rocky Mountains. What is key, the report stresses, is how state and federal governments are responding and what land and natural resource conservation strategies can be embraced or expanded to counter the impacts. ""I think the bottom line is that these impacts are not going to happen 50 or 100 years from now,"" said Bruce Stein, director of climate change adaption with the National Wildlife Federation.""Many of them are already here, and we are going to have to be rethinking what we do to protect our wildlife and how we build and protect our communities."" In addition to climate changes causing heat waves in the summer, the report highlights a surprise revelation that its biggest effect occurs in the winter months. Those warmer winters are enhancing pest outbreaks and accelerating the melting of snowpack each year, reducing the amount of water that's available later when needed. The report, Impacts of Climate Change on Biodiversity, Ecoystems and Ecosystem Services, was peer-reviewed by the U.S. Geological Survey and drew on the expertise of 60 contributors from government agencies, universities and private, non-profit organizations such as The Nature Conservancy. The report foreshadows the National Climate Assessment, a report done every four years for the U.S. president and Congress charting projections in global change for the next 25 to 100 years. Done by the U.S. Global Change Research Program, that report is anticipated to be released in draft form in January and available for public comment. In a teleconference Tuesday highlighting key findings of the biodiversity report, moderator Mary Grimm said U.S. ecosystems are already undergoing ""massive"" transformations as the result of climate change. ""Ecological systems are already more stressed than at any comparable period in human history, said Grimm, a senior sustainability scientist at Arizona State University's Global Institute of Sustainability. The report notes that forests are already responding to climate change, with longer growing seasons and warmer winters that enhance pest outbreaks such as rampant bark beetle infestations. Such attacks are leading to widespread die-offs of trees in forests, sparking increased risks for more severe and extensive fires. ""If trends continue,"" the report warned, ""baseline tree mortality rates in western forests are projected to double every 17 to 29 years."" Peter Groffman, a microbial ecologist at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millibrook, N.Y., said their research turned up a significant surprise ? that climate change's impacts are playing out more dramatically in the winter than in other seasons. While assumptions and most research bemoans climate change with its potential for arid heat waves in the summer, those increasing temperatures during the winter months have substantial consequences as well, Groffman said. ""Climate change is more dramatic in the winter than we thought,"" he said. ""Those changes have effects on biodiversity and ecoystems in the growing season,"" and accelerate snowmelt and even changes in peak runoff, which can come earlier. ""In the Colorado River basin, water shortages are expected as a consequence of changes in snowmelt timing,"" the report notes. ""Acceleration of the annual melting of snowpack may reduce water availability later in the summer when it is most needed, particularly in the more arid regions such as the western United States."" By 2050, climate change will triple the fraction of counties in the  United States that are at high or extremely high risk of outstripping  their water supplies, from 10 percent to 32 percent, the report notes, adding that the most at-risk  areas in the United States are the West, Southwest and Great Plains  regions. Stein said water managers, particularly those in the Colorado River basin that includes Utah, are already responding to the threat of such shortages. ""'Water managers are planning their operations with climate in context, taking into account what is known as the 'new normal,'"" he said. ""Much of our water management was developed at a time when there was good supply of precipitation. Over the last 10 to 15 years, we can see that has changed. Along the Colorado, they are beginning to recalibrate their assumptions and accordingly recalibrate how they are managing the river and their allocations."" The study points to strides and real progress on the ground that demonstrates that government can be responsive and smart in the threat of climate change, and the public-private partnerships out there to curtail its range of potential consequences. An example is a tree-thinning program instituted in Arizona, which experienced its largest wildfire on record in 2011. Still, the fire did not burn ridges where the thinning had happened. Such strategy invoked in advance of catastrophic wildfires can help reduce other threats, such as flash flooding that can imperil drinking water supplies, the report notes. ""The nexus of climate and forest fires is a flashpoint for several other degraded ecosystems such as water supply and water quality,"" the report said. The report said that the federal government is beginning to take action by managing programs with climate change as a component. Several states, too, have formal climate change adaptation programs on the books, and even those that don't are approaching the management of fish and wildlife with strategies that incorporate conservation in a broad sense, including habitat restoration and landscape connectivity.

"5","Article 5","The American West is going to burn up.The situation is perilous now and it's only going to get worse, according to a 2016 study - ""Climate Change Blamed for Half of Increased Forest Fire Danger"" - published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The study reported that longer fire seasons and more burned acres of forest are likely to continue as long as there is enough fuel to burn, but there will come a point, probably in the middle of the century, when there are not enough trees left to sustain wildfires.Wildfires also release carbon dioxide, one of the main drivers of climate change, and reduce the number of trees available to absorb carbon dioxide, a double whammy for the atmosphere.Since 1979, climate change has been responsible for more than half the drying of Western forests and the increased length of the fire season. After 1984, those factors enlarged the cumulative forest fire area by 16,000 square miles, about the size of Massachusetts and Connecticut combined. Cyclical climate variations would have dried out the landscape some, but human-caused climate change on top of those patterns caused this drying process to double. It's a sobering prognosis.The year 2015 was the worst for forest fires on record, and 2016 brought the huge Idaho Pioneer fire, the  ninth-most-expensive fire in U.S. history. Now we have the phenomenally destructive brush fires in Southern California, which is likely to make 2017 the worst fire year ever.During late summers in the West, smoke can force people indoors or to wear masks. It has not always been this way. Between Boise and Lowman, Idaho, totally blackened and dead landscapes resulted from the Pioneer fire. Current forest fires get so hot they kill everything - vegetation, animals, even the soil, which actually melts, sterilizing it. Contemporary Western fires are more severe (burn longer, hotter, are 100 percent destructive and move faster) because the vegetation is a powder keg, stressed by dryness and disease. If you suffer more from respiratory ailments, like asthma, than you did in the past, it is likely due to increased smoke.The PNAS report misleads by stating that climate change is to be blamed for the fires. No, we are to blame. That subtlety unintentionally gets us off the hook, and climate change becomes our scapegoat. Climate change itself is blameless. It is, actually, like blaming a gun for killing. Climate change and guns are simply our impartial agents of destruction.If you are still looking for a huge environmental disaster that can be directly linked to human-caused climate change, you need look no further than forest fires. Furthermore, no longer are scientists reticent to link these meteorological disasters (not just fires) to humans. The New York Times recently ran an article (""How Global Warming Fueled Five Extreme Weather Events"") based on a collection of papers published Dec. 13 in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society.Summarizing the research published:Researchers analyzed 27 extreme weather events from 2016 and found that human-caused climate change was a ""significant driver"" for 21 of them. Five of those extreme weather events included: 1) Record temperatures around the world; 2) Coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef; 3) Drought in Africa; 4) Wildfires in North America; and 5) The warm ""blob"" in the Pacific Ocean (the blob has allowed toxic algae blooms to spread across the region, killing seabirds by the thousands and forcing local fisheries to close).What can we do now?1) We can fight any effort on the part of big government and their bedfellows, the fossil fuel industry, and any influential monied interests that deny the significance of climate change. They reject the fact that excess production of carbon dioxide and methane, the two major climate change gases, causes the atmospheric temperature to rise. The fossil fuel industry as well as obstructionists in government must disappear, and the faster the better. To encourage coal and natural gas production, whether it is by reducing the size of national monuments to allow for more exploratory activities or giving coal miners false hopes, is patently immoral.2) We can join environmental organizations like Citizens' Climate Lobby, a huge international grass-roots advocacy organization focused on national policies to address climate change.Most climate change scientists agree that the clock is ticking to stabilize and reduce the climate change gases in the atmosphere. When that mother of all tipping points is reached, and some believe it is only a few years away, it really is too late."
"6","Article 6","A group of delegates traveled to Washington, D.C., recently and met with their legislators to discuss climate change and proposed cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency.Retired fire chief John Woodland, of St. Regis, went as one of the Montana delegates.The group was made up of individuals from six states including Montana, Colorado, Missouri, Maine and Pennsylvania. The original focus of the Sept. 13 meeting was on the impending vote for the proposed cuts that was later postponed until December.The Trump administration has proposed a 31 percent cut to the EPA's budget to $5.7 billion from $8.1 billion and to eliminate a quarter of the agency jobs.Several offices are under the agency's umbrella including the Office of Land and Emergency Management (which oversees Superfund sites) and the EPA also oversees general environmental protection laws such as Air Pollution Act; Water Pollution Act; Endangered Species Act; Toxic Substances Control Act and National Environmental Policy Act.The trip was organized by some environmental groups including the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters.Woodland is a member of the Montana Chapter of the environmental group 350.org. He also has a strong background in firefighting and is concerned about climate change and the impact it is having on wildfires.""We had an extreme fire season this year and in our particular area we had the hottest July on record. Missoula had the longest period on record without any measureable rainfall. We need to get serious about addressing climate change and getting off of fossil fuel,"" Woodland stated.The other delegates who went from Montana included Travis Craft, a fly fishing guide from Missoula; Mike Jarnevic, who is retired from the military and was involved with the Milltown Dam Superfund cleanup; Alisha Jongeward, a Livingston High School physics teacher; Gary Hawk, a retired Missoula minister; and Dave Merrill, with the Sierra Club.They met with Montana's U.S. senators, Dmocrat Jon Tester and Republican Steve Daines, as well as with a staffer for U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte, another Republican. Topics discussed included the impact the wildfires have had on tourism, teaching climate change in the schools, and ethical issues surrounding climate change.""Climate change is manmade and the science is very clear and we are seeing the impact of that science,"" Woodland said. ""What can we do about it?""His main focus on the visit was to discuss wildfires and the impact they had on Montana tourism, smoke health concerns and the possible impact on future business development.""How many new startups and tech companies look at moving to Montana because they like the lifestyle here? But after a summer like this one, they saw that the lifestyle wasn't that pleasant (with the smoke) and left as a result.""Both Tester and Daines support full funding for the EPA, but they don't share the same view on climate change.""I've talked to Tester several times over the years. He's a farmer and they (farmers) pretty much accept the idea that climate change is happening, there's no denying it,"" he said.""This is a critically important topic because it impacts everybody, not only in Montana, but on this Earth,"" Tester said during an August meeting in Bozeman on climate change.Tester was also on the other side of the fence from Daines regarding the confirmation of Scott Pruitt as the head of the EPA in February of this year. Tester did not support the appointment and said in an earlier interview that Pruitt sided with big polluters over local businesses and local families. He also told the group that he's concerned about how effective the EPA was going to be since the leadership ""seems to deny a lot of the science that's out there at this point.""Daines, on the other hand, supported Pruitt and wants to see less regulation on oil and coal industries which he said are burdened with ""excessive EPA regulation.""Both Daines and Tester want to see funding continue for Montana Superfund sites including the Berkeley Pit in Butte.However, Daines didn't address the climate change issue very much during the delegates' meeting. Instead he focused most of the wildfire blame on poor forest management, something Woodland disagrees with.""You can't blame the fire situation just on timber management,"" Woodland said. He points out that the fire seasons are getting longer and that has nothing to do with timber management.""Canada doesn't have the same timber management as we have and they are having extreme fires, as well,"" he said. He also pointed out that Eastern Montana does not have the forests seen in the western part of the state and they had extreme fires this summer.Another problem with Mineral County is that it has a lot of low value lodgepole timber, which can be difficult to access --  a problem not resolved by logging but by Forest Services crews doing forest management and thinning those areas.Currently, the Forest Service does not have the staffing needed to do this type of ground work or to do the work needed before the timber sales happens. Firefighting is also more expensive now, with more homes in the urban-wildland interface and increases in the cost of fuel and equipment.   ""Their budget has not be raised appropriately,"" Woodland said.""The Forest Service and environmental groups get blamed for challenging timber sales and I don't think they deserve the blame that they're getting,"" he said. ""We aren't giving the agencies who are responsible for doing the forest management the resources and tools needed to do it.""Regarding the timber industry in Montana, Woodland points out that Montana is a ""dry forest"" and there isn't much water and dry soil conditions. Essentially it takes 100 years to grow marketable timber in this area versus places like Washington and Oregon where the wet conditions can grow timber in about 30 years.Plus with climate change, the area is shifting from a ""dry forest"" to essentially a ""high desert"" brush and shrub area, he said, referencing a 2017 Montana Climate Assessment report. The report stated that ""the speed and magnitude of climate change may mean an increased forest mortality ... leading to a net loss of forested area in Montana.""What Woodland advocates is the need to decrease the use of fossil fuels and to use more alternative energies like wind and solar.Overall, he felt the trip was worthwhile, ""I don't think this trip by itself will result in fundamental changes in thinking, but incrementally people that understand the science and are concerned about it will start to connect the dots and start to do something about it."""
"7","Article 7","By the end of the century, the manifold consequences of unchecked climate change will cost the U.S. hundreds of billions of dollars per year, according to a new study by scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency.Those costs will come in the form of water shortages, crippled infrastructure and polluted air that shortens lives, among others, according to the study in Monday's edition of Nature Climate Change. No part of the country will be untouched, the EPA researchers warned.However, they also found that cutting emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, and proactively adapting to a warming world, would prevent a lot of the damage, reducing the annual economic toll in some sectors by more than half.Experts called the report the most comprehensive analysis yet of the staggering diversity of societal impacts that climate change will have on the American economy.""It is an extraordinarily ambitious project,"" said Solomon Hsiang, an economist at UC Berkeley who was not involved in the study.The analysis is not the first to calculate the costs of global warming and the benefits of curtailing emissions. There have been numerous prior attempts, including a 2006 report commissioned by the British government that found unmitigated warming could reduce global gross domestic product by as much as 20%.Many more have followed, but all reach the same general conclusion, said Brenda Ekwurzel, director of climate science at the Union of Concerned Scientists: ""The cost of inaction is really high, and (the cost of) reducing emissions pales in comparison.""What sets the new study apart, she said, is its astonishing level of detail. It explores how 22 different impacts of climate change - from rising sea levels to longer pollen seasons to the economic prospects of ski resorts - will play out across the nation.""There are no regions that escape some mix of adverse impacts,"" wrote authors Jeremy Martinich and Allison Crimmins.The findings clash with the views of President Trump and many of his appointees, who have repeatedly downplayed the risks of climate change. The EPA did not make the study authors available for interviews.The report summarizes years of work by scores of scientists as part of the EPA's Climate Change Impact and Risk Analysis.For each type of impact, researchers modeled the effects of climate change under a scenario in which the world took no serious actions to reduce emissions. They also considered a more moderate scenario - one not ambitious enough to meet international goals of keeping warming to about 1.5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels but aggressive enough to limit global temperature rise to about 2 degrees C.Some of the results came out in the Fourth National Climate Assessment, released last year.Among them were the sobering projections that damage to coastal property, primarily on the Gulf and East coasts, will reach $120 billion per year by 2090; lost labor productivity due to hotter temperatures, particularly in the South and Midwest, will cost $155 billion per year; and deaths from extreme heat waves and cold snaps will equal $140 billion per year.When asked about those conclusions in November 2018, Trump told reporters, ""I don't believe it.""The new study offers an even richer picture of the EPA's analysis, said Ekwurzel, who contributed to the climate assessment. It shows how many of the effects of climate change break down by state _ and often by individual county or watershed.""It's kind of like, all politics is local. Climate change is the same,"" she said: Every place will face a unique combination of climate impacts.The results align with those of a 2017 study led by Hsiang, which suggested that the southern U.S. will be particularly hard hit thanks to the converging effects on coastal property, labor productivity and extreme temperature mortality. But the new analysis shows that no region will be exempt from losses.For instance, most of the northern half of the country will experience greater air pollution because of climate change. The Midwest will see more harmful algal blooms, like those that have choked Lake Erie in recent years. And the Northwest will experience a spike in electricity demand, mainly for cooling, and endure more severe flooding.A handful of places could enjoy small economic gains in certain sectors. The results suggest that some parts of the inter-mountain West may get a boost in water supply, for example.But California won't be so lucky. Residents have already become familiar with some of the climate impacts that will become more common in the state, such as wildfires and flooding.The study suggests that climate change will also bring more mosquitoes that carry West Nile virus. It will increase the temperatures of streams and lakes, reducing oxygen levels and harming water quality. Heavy river flows will put many bridges at risk, and intense heat will buckle rail lines.The report also makes one of the first attempts to study the connections between various climate impacts. For instance, the authors note that energy costs will rise more dramatically in places where increased energy demand coincides with reduced water supply, because many power plants require water for cooling.However, the researchers point out that the high cost of climate impacts can be recast as the benefits the country stands to reap by cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Keeping warming closer to 2 degrees would prevent tens of billions of dollars in lost labor productivity, extreme temperature mortality and energy costs alone.Across all sectors, that works out to between $250 and $600 of savings per person per year by the end of the century, the researchers calculated.""You can really save the U.S. economy lots of money,"" Ekwurzel said.In some cases, reducing emissions will not be enough to avoid impacts. For instance, coastal areas will see more sea-level rise in coming decades, even if the world acts swiftly.So the researchers considered how efforts to adapt to a warmer world might reduce economic damages.They found that measures such as elevating buildings and constructing seawalls could significantly decrease damage to coastal properties. Maintaining roads and railroads _ preferably before they fall into disrepair _ could also offset many of the costs of climate impacts.Overall, however, experts said the study still probably underestimates the true cost of climate change.""There are big uncertainties, but in general, the uncertainties always err on the side of making it more damaging,"" said Frances Moore, a climate change economist at UC Davis who was not involved in the study.(EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE)That's because no study can include every sector of the economy, and some impacts _ like the potential for global warming to fuel violent conflicts and spur migration _ are almost impossible to quantify but will most likely add to the burden, she said.Even so, Hsiang said the new research lays the groundwork for a meaningful conversation about the risks of letting climate change continue unabated.""The climate may be one of the largest economic assets this nation holds,"" he said. ""We should manage it with the seriousness and clarity of thought that we would apply to managing any asset that generates trillions of dollars in value."""
"8","Article 8","On May 30, Gov. Mark Gordon joined U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, Utah Governor Gary Herbert and Thomas Farrell, CEO of the gas and electric utility Dominion Energy on stage in the Grand Ballroom of the 775-room Grand America Hotel in Salt Lake City.The panel was part of a Herbert-hosted, Dominion-sponsored energy summit. Of the politicians and executives in attendance, Gordon alone wore cowboy boots.Twenty minutes into the panel discussion, climate change protestors rushed and occupied the stage. The two dozen or so protesters chanted and sang slogans: ""your time is up"" and ""keep it in the ground."" They unfurled banners that said much of the same, along with other slogans: ""100% renewable energy"" and ""Invest in our Future, Not Climate Change.""The activists held the stage for about four minutes before being escorted off without protest. Herbert suggested the protesters should have their own conference, rather than ""disrupt what we have done here.""But Gordon, who last summer spent his primary campaign defending himself from opponents' charges that he was a secret foe of fossil fuels, offered protesters his résumé as an environmentalist.""Just a couple of things you should know,"" Gordon said, speaking in fragmented sentences. ""Board of directors at Sierra Club,"" a position he held in the 1990s, ""got my first job working for Friends of the Earth back in 1980. Known Armory Lovins, who is the Soft Energy Path guy, since I was 14.""""We are still friends and we are still working on those problems,"" Gordon continued. ""The problem is that we in this country have tried to suggest that a 100% renewable portfolio is somehow going to address climate change. It will reduce that amount of carbon we release in the atmosphere domestically ... but it doesn't take carbon out of the atmosphere. It doesn't address climate change and what we can do with coal.""Address climate change with coal? While it sounds paradoxical, the concept lies at the heart of the governor's vision for saving Wyoming's most valuable industry.Though the idea likely raised eyebrows in Salt Lake City, it was consistent with what Gordon said to the University of Wyoming Board of Trustees two weeks earlier.""Wyoming has the solutions for our climate,"" Gordon told the trustees, according to a report in the Laramie Boomerang. ""If you push as hard as you can to put a 100% renewable platform on this planet, you have done nothing to eliminate carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. We can take our coal products and we can make them part of the solutions.""It's even somewhat consistent with what he told President Donald Trump and other state governors during a lunch at the White House last week.""The President has been a strong supporter of coal and advancing new technologies that support carbon capture and sequestration that is critical in addressing climate change and to provide a bridge to a cleaner and healthier future and really good jobs,"" Gordon said.But is the coal-as-climate-savior approach a fundamental shift or simply the next in a litany of coal lifelines pitched by Wyoming power-brokers?For his part, Gordon speaks more about climate change as reality than most Wyoming politicians. Even he, however, couches such discussions in the ""political reality"" of climate change. The phrase is shorthand among conservative policy makers, and increasingly Wyoming politicians, for 'like-it-or-not, market and electoral forces require that we deal with this.'In office, Gordon is not acting as a foe to the coal industry. He's called for technological advances to stem the tide of coal plant closures, advocated for increased coal exports and even wants to sue Washington state over its rejection of a coal export terminal permit that could help Wyoming mines. Last year he asked lawmakers for $10 million to build a small-scale coal plant with carbon capture technologies. They gave him $5 million.There is little new there. Former Gov. Matt Mead supported efforts to open coal plants for export on the West Coast. Mead also took strides to establish Wyoming as a research hub for carbon capture technologies that could be attached to coal plants.But Gordon is also calling for a new path for Wyoming with a technology called ""bio-energy with carbon capture storage."" BECCS, an as-yet-unproven technology could - its backers claim - turn coal-fired power plants from carbon emitters to carbon subtractors.It's what Gordon calls ""carbon negative coal solutions.""If it's viable, the technology could give Wyoming another dog in the fight for coal's future.In his first budget proposal this fall, Gordon plans to ask the Legislature for money - he's uncertain yet how much - to chase matching grants from the U.S. Department of Energy so UW researchers can pursue the technology, he told WyoFile last month.But in a state where large wind energy projects are underway and solar energy is beginning to entice investment, critics say Wyoming needs to let go of coal and instead prepare its workers, communities and tax structure for transition. The race has been run, they say, and no one is looking for new coal technology in a world where cleaner natural gas, and even renewable energy, are increasingly more economical to build than coal plants.In April the federal data that seemed to confirm predictions espoused by Gordon's friend Armory Lovins in the 1970's: renewable energy sources surpassed coal on the electrical grid for the first time.""The energy grid is being transformed literally as we speak,"" said David Schlissel, an economist with the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.""It's not a matter of 'if' and it's barely a matter of 'when' anymore because it's happening,"" Schlissel said. ""Either you get swamped by the tsunami of renewables, or else ... you get on a surfboard and ride the wave.""But Wyoming keeps betting it can beat the tide and its new governor is joining in. And as with most things Wyoming coal, the play centers on Campbell County and the Powder River Basin.Brought to life during the Mead administration, coal boosters tout the Integrated Test Center north of Gillette as a cutting-edge laboratory for the solution to carbon dioxide emissions.But as yet, this hotbed of carbon innovation remains a dirt lot with some unused pipes and an empty modular office building.The Basin Electric Power Cooperative's Dry Fork Station looms above the site, five pipes rise from the ground. On the east side of the plant another, larger, pipe hookup awaits.The pipes connect to Dry Fork's ""stack."" The Dry Fork Station is the newest coal fired power plant in the country, and for many pollutants - sulfur, mercury, particulate matter - the cleanest. Both mercury and sulfur emissions out of the stack stay well below the levels prescribed in its environmental permit, according to an August, 2018 profile in industry publication Power Magazine.But the stack at the Dry Fork Station still emits carbon dioxide, the principal global-warming gas of concern, unabated.The empty pipe heads await a carbon-capturing savant.Possibly as soon as this fall, engineers from five countries will descend on the ITC, bringing their ideas for capturing, storing, or best of all using, the plant's carbon emissions. Next summer, Japanese motor builder Kawasaki will join the fray, while a Denver company with a carbon-capture idea may start experimenting with Dry Fork's carbon emissions as soon as July, said Jason Begger, executive director of the Wyoming Infrastructure Authority, which runs the project.Under Mead, Wyoming taxpayers invested $15 million in the ITC, Begger said. Private-sector energy interests kicked in $6 million more. Those funds will last until 2027, he said.To provide longevity to the coal industry, a magic-bullet technology needs to capture enough carbon to assuage a world alarmed by climate change. It needs to be cheap enough to entice utility operators into retrofitting aging coal plants instead of shuttering them and moving on. It needs to arrive soon, as in maybe yesterday. Closures loom for many of the power plants fed by trainloads of Powder River Basin coal.Kipp Coddington, director of Energy Policy & Economics at UW's School of Energy Resources, is optimistic that such a technology can arrive in time. Wyoming's efforts at carbon capture go back a decade, he said. Coddington now sees a fertile mix of the infrastructure, policies and research necessary for success.""Wyoming in my humble view is one of the handful of jurisdictions worldwide where, if this is going to happen commercially, it's going to happen here,"" he said.Coddington sees three paths forward for coal in the face of diminishing demand from electric utilities. New technologies could siphon carbon from power plant emissions and store it underground to make coal power compatible in a carbon conscious world. Better yet, commercially successful uses for carbon could emerge that create demand for the captured carbon and and subsidize its collection.Finally, the black rock could avoid combustion altogether, and instead be used to produce new materials instead of electricity.Researchers and companies are expected to pursue all three approaches in Campbell County, and boosters like Gillette-raised entrepreneur Jim Ford like the multi-pronged approach.There's the 10,000 foot well drilled just east of the ITC under the auspices of the energy-department-funded CarbonSAFE project. Scientists at UW's School of Energy Resources, which Coddington called one of the top five or six teams in the field worldwide, are using the well to explore how to best stash carbon emissions underground.""Bring your knowledge,"" Ford, who works part time for the ITC, said. ""Bring your expertise and plug in and do something about [carbon], or do something with it."" Like others in coal-built Gillette, Ford is tired of the slings and arrows of climate worriers from elsewhere. ""Don't just complain and lob shells,"" he said.Schlissel, the IEEFA economist, called carbon capture ""unproven,"" and as yet, uneconomical. IEEFA's stated goal is ""accelerating the transition to a diverse, sustainable and profitable energy economy."" A recent study by Schlissel and that group concluded government-funded attempts to develop economic carbon capture technologies have a record of ""dismal performance"" so far.The study concluded the federal government had spent ""billions"" pursuing carbon-capture technologies over a decade without success.The problem is simply numbers, Schlissel said. Capturing carbon today adds about $60 to the cost of a megawatt hour of coal fired electricity. That makes it cost $70 more a megawatt hour than the current cost of wind energy in Colorado, according to the report.""Why would anybody do that?"" Schlissel asked. ""It doesn't make sense.""Installing the technology to a coal plant also carries significant capital costs. With much of the U.S. coal fleet aging, there's little incentive for utilities to make the investment.""Take an old car that runs fine now but it's old,"" said Rob Godby, the director of the University of Wyoming's Center for Energy Economics and Public Policy. ""Why would you put a new motor in it? Or not even a new motor, an entirely new interior. A really expensive stereo. At a certain point you just say I'm going to invest in a new car and get rid of the old one.""Even Coddington, the policy chief at the UW School of Energy Resource, a place well-invested in carbon-capture research, said there's reason to be skeptical.""At the 10,000 foot level there's tremendous optimism and that's why all this work has to go forward,"" he said. ""It gets immediately very complicated, largely for economic reasons, when you look at a particular plant and say why aren't they doing carbon capture and storage?""It's a race against time and coal plant closures, Coddington said.""In order to maintain Powder River Basin coal, large chunks of that cohort are going to have to deploy this technology,"" he said. ""Do I think that is likely? I just don't know.""For many plants, it's a ""heavy lift,"" he said. Still, Coddington sees chances.A new federal tax credit may make carbon capture technology more economical for utilities. While the U.S. coal fleet is aging out, he said, some countries continue to invest in the plants. Utilities and governments abroad may see more reason to make investments in carbon capture technologies. There could even be a ""coal renaissance"" where new plants are built with carbon capture technologies if they become economical, Coddington said.Predictions for the economic viability of carbon capture often depend on a profitable use for the captured gas.The most economical use of captured carbon developed so far is enhanced oil recovery - pumping it into old oil wells to stimulate production. Of course, oil, too, releases carbon dioxide when burned.""From a climate point of view it's kind of insane,"" Schlissel said.Would it then be better not to burn the coal at all? In Campbell County, there are ideas for that too.Ford's previous employer, Atlas Carbon, for example, uses coal to make filters, including ones used to make the Dry Fork Station burn cleaner than its predecessors. Atlas Carbon developed technology that grinds coal down to a level finer than cigarette smoke or ink toner, Ford said, which the plant uses as a filter ""like a big carbon cloud"" to absorb the mercury.Last spring, Atlas Carbon received a $15 million loan from the state.Atlas is far from alone in looking for new uses for coal. But if the goal is preserving the mining industry there's a problem. Power plants are high-volume customers. Powder River Basin mines shipped around 293 million tons to power plants last year.Turning coal into products doesn't come anywhere close to that kind tonnage. Atlas Carbon goes through a limited amount of coal a year, Ford said, about ""a fraction of the production from a small-scale mine up here.""Coal mines provided more than 4,700 direct jobs in Campbell County.A 'coal products' industry would look different. The jobs would be fewer, but they would likely be high-paying and bring a new level of technical expertise to the area, proponents argue.A lower-coal-volume industry also wouldn't do much to fill state coffers under the current tax structure.""We've got to help ourselves,"" Gillette mayor Louise Carter-King said. ""I don't think we're going to get help from many other places. There's gotta be a way to use this natural resource that we have that's not harmful to the climate.""In Salt Lake City, Gordon offered the climate protesters an engineering proposal. To address climate change, a renewable energy system could be paired with BECCS.The technology uses a coal-fired plant to burn biofuels like agricultural waste, weeds and grasses, which pull carbon from the atmosphere as they grow. A BECCS plant would use carbon capture and storage technology to keep CO2 from the atmosphere. As new biomass is grown to fuel the plant it captures more carbon. The idea, in theory, is that by growing new plants, burning them without releasing carbon, replacing them and repeating the capture process as they grow the process reduces the carbon in the atmosphere.""It requires a commitment and courage to move forward,"" Gordon told the crowd. ""It's frustrating to me that instead of having a good conversation, what we do is polarize and as part of that polarization we will not listen to each other.""Gordon sees BECCS as a way for Wyoming coal to carve out a place for itself as the world moves to curb the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, he says. ""We have the opportunity to take a fully-functioning industry with a footprint in place and actually turn it into part of the climate solution,"" he said. ""This is potentially a real solution.""There are significant challenges to BECCS. It's an unproven and largely undeveloped technology. And environmentalists have their doubts. Those opposed to the technology say its not certain burning large amounts of biomass will lead to negative emissions, and that the ecological costs of harvesting the biomass may be too great.It's also unclear whether Wyoming, full of coal but not known for its rapid vegetation growth, is a good place to locate a BECCS plant. Trees or biomass may have to be imported from elsewhere, or significant changes to the landscape would have to occur. For BECCS to have a negative carbon impact, the growth cycle for the source materials needs to be significantly accelerated.The economists interviewed for this article agree nations will need ways to pull carbon out of the atmosphere if the world hopes to curb the worst impacts of climate change. Whether there's a place for a ""carbon negative coal solution"" in that quest remains to be seen.""The question of pulling CO2 out of the atmosphere should be studied,"" Schlissel said. ""There are technologies that are able to do that but that's different than keeping a coal plant running.""Still, Schlissel conceded that coal plants aren't going away soon. Other countries, particularly in Asia, continue to build them. ""The transition is going to take decades and there will still be coal plants operating for a long time,"" he said.That's why Begger still sees a business opportunity for the state. ""There's an incredible market opportunity behind carbon management,"" said Begger.For the climate-change concerned, it's something Wyoming could do to help stem the tide. ""Personally, I think we need to talk about [BECCS],"" Godby said. ""If as a country or as a world we're going to meet our climate goals, it's gotta be everything.""What [Gordon] would argue, and I would agree with him on this, is who has more at stake to develop that than us?"" Godby said.Wyoming's research into carbon capture isn't wholly focused on saving coal electricity, though it is often pitched that way in the political arena. The research could lead to new cottage industries like Atlas Carbon', an exportable technology with a Wyoming patent, or, as Gordon suggests, even a Wyoming solution for the world's carbon problem.In hanging on to coal, however, Wyoming may be missing opportunities. ""I'd focus on solar and wind,"" Schlissel said. ""And I'd focus on not only using them but I'd build manufacturing facilities. I'd give incentives to companies to come to Wyoming. Let's give jobs and retraining to the people who are going to lose their jobs in the Powder River Basin.""Gordon argues Wyoming will be at the center of energy development, including wind energy, regardless. ""No matter what happens in our energy future Wyoming is in the crosshairs,"" he said. Predictions show much of the wind energy northwestern states are seeking to green their grids will come from Montana and Wyoming, he said.Indeed, the largest onshore wind farm in North America is planned for Carbon County and construction could start soon on the 1,000-turbine project. Other large wind projects proceed elsewhere in the state.In an interview, Gordon expressed some concern at the impact large wind development would have on the state. ""Now you're talking about the landscape,"" he said. ""It seems to me there's a value that should be ascribed to that landscape.""""This isn't a statement anti-wind,"" he said. But, ""if we can do something that's carbon negative using the same footprint and doesn't have to stand up a bunch of new generating capacity from another technology be it solar or wind, can we have a mix here that's beneficial for all involved?""Asked by WyoFile if he thinks BECCS could be viable within eight years (the duration of Gordon's governorship if he wins reelection) Gordon didn't have a concrete answer. But, he said, ""I think it's probably one of the most urgent things we can do to remove carbon from the atmosphere so I hope we won't dilly dally around getting that done."""
"9","Article 9","Talk about greenhouse gases is in the air, and it's not just coming from Al Gore. The Arizona Public Interest Research Group released a report this month that says Arizona ranks among the top 10 states for largest increase in carbon dioxide emissions from 1960 to 2001. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas thought to be responsible for global warming. Later this month, a 34-member climate-change advisory group appointed by Governor Napolitano is expected to issue a report on its own findings. The panel - made up of environmentalists, government officials and business leaders - met for the final time June 22. The Arizona PIRG report, ""The Carbon Boom,"" dovetailed with the release of similar reports by other PIRG chapters around the country.In Arizona, the report said, two sources accounted for more than 90 percent of the increase in carbon-dioxide emissions: motor vehicles and coal-fired generating stations. Hotter summers ahead Diane Brown, Arizona PIRG's executive director, said global warming spurred by an increase in greenhouse gases would mean hotter summers in the already hot Arizona desert, and then some. ""Many people think one or two degrees, when it's already 110, isn't going to change day to day life,"" Ms. Brown says. ""However, when you look at the ramifications, particularly in Arizona, we should be concerned about future water shortages and extreme droughts. "" Those degrees of additional heat, she added, can lead to more heat-related illnesses and stress. According to the report, Arizona's overall carbon-dioxide emissions rose to 87.6 million tons from 15.5 million tons in the four decades surveyed, a fivefold increase. The figures come from data compiled by the U.S. Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a PIRG news release said. Texas had the largest carbon-dioxide output of any state in 2001, the latest year for which data are available - some 668.5 million tons, up from 240.7 tons in 1960. During that time, the United States as a whole saw carbon dioxide emissions nearly double, going from just under 3 billion tons to 5.7 billion tons. Ms. Brown said PIRG seeks less reliance on energy sources like oil (including gasoline for automobiles) and coal for electricity, and greater reliance on energy sources that don't create greenhouse gases. Without change, she said, ""Arizona's rapidly increasing population will further exacerbate the global-warming problem. "" In addition, she said, more energy-efficient homes could be built and equipped with more energy-efficient appliances, though some standards already exist. The state also could take steps to promote cleaner-burning vehicles like hybrids, she said. H2429 offers tax credits for solar installations Renewable resources like solar and wind power should be encouraged, Ms. Brown said, citing one bill recently passed by the Legislature. H2429 would, among other things, offer tax credits for solar-energy installations. In addition, Ms. Brown gave high marks to the Arizona Corporation Commission for proposing that 15 percent of electricity generated by utilities like Arizona Public Service and Tucson Electric Company come from renewable sources by 2025. Ms. Brown, however, criticized Salt River Project - which the commission does not regulate - for moving too slowly in cutting back on energy generated from its coal-fired power plants. The PIRG report said more than half the increase in Arizona's carbon dioxide emissions since 1960 has come from burning coal. After three large coal-fired plants were built in Coconino County around the mid-1970s, carbon-dioxide emissions from coal nearly quadrupled, according to the PIRG report. SRP operates the plants, known collectively as the Navajo Generating Station, and has a 21 percent stake, SRP officials said. Referring to SRP, Ms. Brown said: ""They need to be increasing their amount of solar, wind and other clean-energy sources. They have adopted a policy that in essence wouldn't move them from where they are today for another decade. "" SRP officials disagreed with the characterization. ""SRP is making substantial investments in renewables and research and development to respond the climate-change challenges,"" said Kevin Wanttaja, SRP's manager of environmental services. The SRP board, he added, voted to make renewable energy sources ""15 percent of our portfolio by 2025. "" That puts the company, a quasi-governmental entity, on track with the Corporation Commission's proposals, Mr. Wanttaja said. ""So our plan is on par with the investor-owned utilities in the state,"" he said. Report due June 30 The governor's climate change panel's final meeting was at SRP headquarters in Tempe. Its report is expected June 30."
"10","Article 10","Last month, the United Nations issued a dire warning: It's too late to stop the effects of global warming, which are fueling record-breaking heat waves, flooding and wildfires. But by dramatically reducing the use of fossil fuels starting now and zeroing out planet-warming gases by midcentury, it noted, the world could prevent greater devastation.In theory, California is already moving in that direction. The state has committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030. And then-Gov. Jerry Brown signed an executive order in 2018 setting an even higher goal: carbon neutrality by 2045, meaning the state would remove as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as it emits.However, the pledge to go carbon neutral is only aspirational at this point. It's an executive order without the force of law. An important bill pending in the Legislature would change that. Assembly Bill 1395 by Assemblymembers Al Muratsuchi (D-Torrance) and Cristina Garcia (D-Bell Gardens) would codify Brown's executive order into law. That's an ambitious but necessary step for the state, which is one of the world's leaders on climate change policy.California has already committed to 100% clean energy by 2045. Electrical power generation is responsible for only about 15% of the state's greenhouse gas emissions. By going carbon neutral, California is committing to slash emissions from everything else, including cars and trucks, home heating and cooking, farms and industrial operations.Specifically, AB 1395 would direct the state to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 90% below 1990 levels by 2045. That would probably mean phasing out gas- and diesel-fueled cars and trucks in favor of zero-emission vehicles; reducing or eliminating natural gas in homes and businesses; ending oil and gas extraction; and cutting methane emissions from oil wells, landfills and farms.For the emissions that cannot be eliminated, the state would pursue technologies that capture carbon dioxide from industrial facilities and that remove existing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Some of these technologies are still being developed or don't even exist yet. The bill would direct state agencies to ensure that carbon capture or removal projects don't end up polluting the surrounding communities or pose a public health risk. That makes sense -- in fighting climate change, we shouldn't sacrifice local environmental protection.There's strong opposition to AB 1395 from the oil and gas sector, the agricultural industry and business groups. They argue the bill moves too fast and doesn't consider the cost and feasibility of slashing greenhouse gas emissions and largely eliminating fossil fuels over the coming decades.The reality is that California and the world must move fast if there is any hope of stopping climate catastrophe. Transitioning an entire economy from fossil fuels to clean technology will be challenging, time consuming and expensive for businesses and residents. But the cost of inaction is unthinkable. If we don't accelerate the work now, it will be nearly impossible to zero out planet-warming emissions by the middle of the century.Last week has brought fresh evidence that climate change is fueling more extreme weather events in California and beyond. The state is again facing unprecedented wildfires, like the Caldor fire near Lake Tahoe that has forced thousands of people to evacuate their homes. Nearly 1 million people are without power and drinking water in Louisiana and Mississippi after a hurricane knocked out electrical lines. Heavy rain caused flooding in New York City's subway system, along with roads and homes throughout the region.The summer has already given us a terrible glimpse of the future if we don't move aggressively now. California can continue to lead the fight against climate change by passing AB 1395."
"11","Article 11","Melting glaciers. Rising seas. Devastating storms. Wildfires.Children are well aware of the unfolding climate crisis - and they're anxious about it. Given that climate change will exact its toll on future generations, they are also stepping up to try to stop it.Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish girl, has become the voice of her generation's call to halt greenhouse-gas emissions. In the United States, children have brought lawsuits against federal and state governments for not acting to limit climate change. And millions of kids worldwide protested in September's Global Climate Strike.Lucy Collmer, 12, and her sister, Vivian, 9, of Vancouver were among them. Lucy had already heard about climate-related trouble, but she found a video in her middle-school science class about melting glaciers particularly upsetting.""It scares me that's happening at such a rapid pace because of what we're doing,"" she said.""Sometimes when we talk about it, it seems like science fiction,"" Vivian added. ""I don't think we're going to be able to go to another planet.""The girls have urged their parents to take steps to reduce the family's environmental impact - and it's not like Sarah and Chris Collmer weren't already making efforts. The couple opposed a biomass plant proposed for downtown Vancouver that was scuttled in 2011. Then they turned their attention to protesting coal and oil trains passing through town.The family has sampled vegan cheese and reduced meat consumption. The Collmers think twice before buying anything. They try to walk from their cozy home in the Hough neighborhood when they have errands nearby.""We've always been interested in environmental issues. Once we had kids, we felt compelled to protect both their current health and their future,"" Sarah Collmer said. ""If your kid is telling you that you need to change your behavior, you've got to listen to that.""Justified anxietyThe Collmers said it's hard to see their young girls feel so burdened.""It is really scary and overwhelming,"" Chris Collmer said. ""But if you look at the science, it's not over. There's a chance to do something but the chance is right now. It's time to act.""The Earth's atmosphere serves as a greenhouse to keep the planet warm and habitable. The amount of heat-trapping gases - mainly carbon dioxide and methane - is increasing, however, as they pump out of industrial smokestacks, power plants, cars and even cattle.Scientists say this has warmed the planet, fueling extreme weather and melting glaciers and ice caps, which in turn causes sea levels to rise. The average global temperature has increased a little more than a degree Fahrenheit since the first United Nations conference to tackle climate change in 1992, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.Global greenhouse gas emissions have increased 1.5 percent annually over the past 10 years, according to a recent U.N. report. To avert the impending climate catastrophe, emissions should have been declining. It would take emissions reductions of 7.6 percent every year between 2020 and 2030 to turn the tide, the report stated.World leaders are gathered in Madrid through Friday for the U.N. Climate Conference to discuss what to do.Americans are no longer in denial: 69 percent think global warming is happening, and 62 percent are worried about it, according to a survey this spring by centers on climate change communication at Yale and George Mason universities.Among teenagers, 7 in 10 believe climate change will harm their generation, according to a September Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll.This growing awareness takes a toll on mental health.Therapists now are reporting that patients bring up anxiety about future climate impacts in their sessions, said Dr. David Pollack, a professor emeritus at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland and an organizer of the nonprofit Climate Psychiatry Alliance.Children, in particular, are distressed.""Kids are not blind to this   and they're alarmed with just cause,"" Pollack said. ""They have much more of their future ahead of them than we do. It's with good reason they are expressing this concern.""When patients have irrational anxieties, therapists might help put those worries in perspective or offer reassurance, Pollack said.""But what about people who have absolutely justifiable concerns?"" he said. ""It creates a kind of clinical conundrum.""Parents face the same conundrum when their children come to them with worries about climate change. It's not like reassuring a child afraid of a monster lurking under the bed."
"12","Article 12","Oct. 16--The launch of Sonoma Clean Power in spring of 2014 is widely cited as the single largest action Sonoma County has taken to address climate change locally.The public agency and the county's dominant electricity provider is credited with reducing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere through large-scale purchase and delivery of renewable power from non-fossil-fuel burning sources, including geothermal and wind. Additional contracts are expected to add solar and more wind power to the mix next year, ambitious moves that represent the agency's core mission of sourcing electricity from county- and state-based sources, while helping to stabilize rates.Now, the Sonoma Clean Power is making another huge bet: that it can convince hundreds of Sonoma County residents over the next two months to ditch their gas-guzzling vehicles for more fuel-efficient wheels. The public agency has launched a new, $2.5 million venture to help people purchase electric vehicles and install at-home charging stations, further advancing efforts to reduce climate change by targeting largest source of pollution in Sonoma County -- tailpipe emissions.""If just 100,000 cars switched from driving on oil to driving on local renewables, we'd go a long way in achieving our climate change goals. That's pretty extraordinary,"" said Geof Syphers, chief executive officer of Sonoma Clean Power. ""The state has some really strong objectives related to reducing emissions, but the state doesn't really know how to achieve them, so this is our opportunity to experiment with relatively low risk.""Starting Oct. 27 and through Jan. 5, Sonoma Clean Power will offer its customers $2,500 discounts -- on a first-come, first-served basis -- to purchase or lease a Nissan Leaf or a BMW i3, two models of electric vehicles on the market. Nissan and BMW have offered additional on-the-spot rebates against the purchase price of the vehicles at Santa Rosa-based Jim Bone Nissan and Hansel BMW.Nissan is offering a $10,000 immediate rebate on Leaf purchases and up to $11,625 for the lease option, and BMW is offering $10,500 off for purchases and $9,500 off for leasing.Low-income Sonoma Clean Power customers are eligible for an even greater discount of $5,000. Additional state rebates and federal tax credits are available for the purchase of electric vehicles.Agency officials say $1.5 million for the electric vehicle program will provide 400 Sonoma Clean Power customers with a $2,500 discount, and 80 low-income customers with $5,000 discounts, not including the dealership incentives. An additional $1 million is available for installation of at home-chargers. Agency officials said the program will provide $1,000 discounts for 1,000 at-home chargers.Sonoma Clean Power's board of directors approved the program Thursday, touting the agency's success over the past two years of keeping electricity rates stable, helping customers save money on their monthly bills and inking long-term renewable energy deals, including solar and wind.""This is a great investment that we should be making,"" said Supervisor Efren Carrillo, who is on the agency's board and who has helped lead the charge to offer government incentives for greater use of electric vehicles. ""I believe we should be encouraging the transformation from combustion engine to electric vehicle.""At present, basic electricity service for Sonoma Clean Power customers has an energy supply that is 37 percent renewable. Under state rules the utility's supply from large hydroelectric projects does not qualify as renewable.The agency serves 193,248 Sonoma County customer accounts, with an additional 44,106 expected in June 2017 after the expansion to Mendocino County is complete. Sonoma Clean Power's board approved an expansion Thursday into unincorporated Mendocino County, and the cities of Fort Bragg, Point Arena and Willits.Syphers said the number of customers in Mendocino County are estimated based on the same opt-out rate in Sonoma County, currently at 12 percent.Some voiced criticism Thursday over the launch of the electric vehicle initiative, saying it appears that Sonoma Clean Power is undertaking a risky role by advertising only a selection of models currently on the market.""You have a situation where they are taking on a business role and becoming a marketing company by preferentially only dealing with manufacturers who will play ball and give big discounts,"" said Andy Ferguson, a Petaluma resident who voiced strong support for the use of electric vehicles but expressed caution over the way in which Sonoma Clean Power is advancing its effort to increase electric vehicle use.""You have to consider the enormous risk to the consumer by being first adopters or buying these cars when the technology is moving so rapidly,"" Ferguson said. ""It might not be as desirable in six months, so the real question is should Sonoma Clean Power be playing favorites in this market?""""Why not just offer a deduction on the consumer's choice for an electric vehicle, and not differentiate between manufacturers?"" he asked.Syphers said the agency invited other manufacturers to participate in the program.""Ford and Chevy have some longer-range electric cars, but they didn't respond,"" Syphers said. ""When we pressed them, they said they weren't interested at this time ... but I think the door is open. We're very interested in being as inclusive as possible.""Jim Bone, the dealer and a partner in the Jim Bone Auto Group in Santa Rosa, said he is excited to participate.""It's ridiculous how low the prices are going to be,"" Bone said. ""I encourage other people to get excited.""Bone said the program offers a great business opportunity for the dealership, and helps the county meet its greenhouse gas reduction goals.""The more electric cars we can put on the roads, the better it's going to be for the environment,"" he said. ""And it's a big opportunity for us. I ordered 100 Leafs for this program, at $34,000 per car ... I'm pretty confident we'll be successful in selling them.""Carrillo expressed strong support, in particular, for the role Sonoma Clean Power can play in offering electric vehicles and charging stations to low-income families. He alluded to data that show lower income people have not benefited from state incentives and federal tax credits at the same level as higher-income earners.A 2015 study from the Energy Institute at Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley found that the wealthiest Americans received 90 percent of federal tax credits for electric vehicles.""We have the aspiration, and the potential, to include communities who have not been invited ... to benefit from new technologies and this electric vehicle revolution,"" Carrillo said. ""I get giddy when I think about reaching out to Head Start families, employees at La Tortilla Factory, Amy's Kitchen.""The agency's Rohnert Park representative was the sole member to vote against the electric vehicle program.Don Schwartz, Rohnert Park assistant city manager who is on the Sonoma Clean Power board, said he was directed by the City Council to vote against any electric vehicle initiative until there is proper funding to address much-needed road repairs.""A lot of revenue for maintaining roads comes from gasoline taxes. The good news is that electric vehicles and higher mileage vehicles reduce carbon emissions, but the down side is there is then less revenue from gasoline taxes to repair the roads,"" Schwartz said. ""So we're exacerbating one problem to fix another.""Schwartz is also concerned about providing government incentives for people to purchase BMWs, as well as the mileage range electric vehicles currently offer.""Range is one of the biggest problems, and we're doing very little to address that problem,"" he said."
"13","Article 13","CHEYENNE - Time is running out on a state legislative committee as it struggles to come up with legislation that will make Wyoming a leader in controlling greenhouse gases.""Whatever you believe about global warming doesn't matter. What matters is the political tide has turned,"" Rep Tom Lubnau, R-Gillette, told the Legislature's Joint Judiciary Committee.Last month the Kansas Department of Health and Environment became the first government agency in the United States to cite carbon dioxide emissions as the reason for rejecting an air permit for a proposed coal-fired electricity generating plant, saying that the greenhouse gas threatens public health and the environment.Lubnau is not a member of the Judiciary Committee, but he represents Gillette, the heart of Wyoming coal country.He pointed to the Kansas decision as evidence of the threat to Wyoming coal as a source of energy.""This is a very big and important part of our economy,"" Lubnau said. ""This is such an important issue to the state that we need to get out ahead of the curve everywhere.""Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels such as coal create greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming, the overwhelming majority of scientists who study climate change say. That causes increases in the average temperature on the planet, often with dire environmental consequences.Gov. Dave Freudenthal has asked the Legislature to create the regulatory framework for dealing with carbon dioxide emissions this session because it is so important to the economy of the state and because the global warming threat has made it so urgent.The committee tabled proposed legislation defining which state agency will regulate underground storage of carbon dioxide and assigned ownership of the underground storage space to the owner of the surface property.The committee has been working with a bill that would make the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission the lead regulatory agency for companies that want to sequester carbon dioxide and hold it underground.But committee member Rep. Mary Thorn, D-Cheyenne, said the appropriate agency to regulate carbon sequestration would be the Department of Environmental Quality.The DEQ handles environmental issues, she said, and putting the Oil and Gas Commission in charge of the process ""would be a substantial shift in the way we have done business for the last 35 years.""The proposed legislation involves both agencies, but DEQ plays a lesser role in the legislation considered Tuesday. Both agencies will have to be involved in any carbon sequestration regulations, lawmakers said, because the issues involved touch both realms.""How we get to that hybrid, I don't know,"" Throne said.But the DEQ protects air, water and general environmental health, while the Oil and Gas Commission protects the oil and gas resources, she said. So DEQ should be in charge.During a break in the meeting, Lubnau spoke with the governor, he said. The governor told him he prefers that the DEQ take the lead role as regulator.Rep. Keith Gingery, R-Jackson, said that Tuesday was the third meeting on the subject and there was not time before the Legislative session to rewrite the bill to make DEQ the lead agency.""DEQ missed the boat,"" Gingery said. ""They are too late in the process.""He said the committee should go forward with the bill and those who think DEQ should be the lead agency can offer amendments at a future meeting. They can also vote against it, he said.Throne said the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has defined the type of drilling required for carbon sequestration as in the regulatory realm of the DEQ, at least while the technology is experimental, which all methods are currently.It will be very difficult for the state to get around the EPA's preference, she said.The committee asked that both the DEQ and the Oil and Gas commission provide them with more information for a meeting in January.Don J. Likwartz, state oil and gas supervisor, made a pitch to the committee that his agency take the lead.He said the agency is funded by a conservation tax and fees on the companies that it regulates and it could take on the function without adding additional staff.The DEQ is funded through the state's General Fund and would have to come up with a budget and fee structure on the regulated entities to offset costs, lawmakers said.Kevin Frederick, supervisor of the DEQ groundwater pollution control program, said DEQ could work with Oil and Gas Commission. Taking the lead role as regulator ""would be fine with us"" as well, he said.The committee also tabled legislation that would assign owner rights to the area underground that would be used to store the carbon dioxide.Jim Magagna, executive vice president of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association, and Ken Hamilton, executive vice president of the Wyoming Farm Bureau, said their organizations support assigning the ownership rights to the surface owner.Marion Loomis, executive director of the Wyoming Mining Association, said he had concerns about the assignment of ownership rights creating new laws that would govern disposal of waste fluids by the industry underground, which it is part of many operations.Large landowners such as farmers and ranchers could sell the rights to store carbon dioxide under their property.The committee tried to craft language that will prevent the new laws from usurping mining laws and regulations already in place, which it will consider as part of the legislation in January.But the committee also heard concerns about liability for the sequestered carbon many years after it is injected into the ground.It also tried to craft language that would prevent the landowners' heirs from inheriting problems.Mark Northam, director of the University of Wyoming School of Energy Resources, said, ""I'm not suggesting that we slow down and wait.""But he said the carbon dioxide pumped underground will force other elements in the earth to migrate, which could cause other problems, such as pollution of ground water, and could be active for generations.Another UW professor, Jeffery Fine said the underground carbon dioxide storage facilities could cover areas as big as a county because of the geologic structures in parts of Wyoming."
"14","Article 14","SALT LAKE CITY - Dozens of Utah's most influential people - including politicians, businesspeople and faith leaders - joined in an online event Wednesday to acknowledge the dangers of climate change and air pollution as well as committing to change.The first-of-its-kind Utah Climate and Clean Air Compact asks all residents to commit to several fundamental principles as Utah seeks to become a ""pragmatic"" leader in climate solutions among conservative states.The virtual signing featured a bipartisan coalition in the state's congressional delegation, with Reps. Ben McAdams and John Curtis voicing support.""Utah has always been a leader in the fight for a healthy climate and clean air, particularly with our innovative clean energy sector,"" Democrat McAdams said. ""And I'm going to continue to work collaboratively to ensure the goals of this compact are met at the federal level.""Curtis, a Republican, touted local stewardship.""Utahns want to take care of this Earth; they want to be good stewards, and this gives them the pathway to do that,"" he said in a prerecorded message.The compact emphasizes six concepts: climate and air quality, the economy, reenergizing Utah, rural Utah, and leadership and ""the Utah way.""The document states that poor air quality has an immediate, negative impact on people's health and that ""climate change poses a large and growing threat to the health and prosperity of Utah communities and beyond.""It asks people to cut back on greenhouse gas emissions by reducing ""auto dependency, improving energy efficiency and advancing innovative energy solutions,"" declaring that the next 10 years are critical in the fight for sustainability.Agriculture, tourism and technology all would benefit, the compact states, calling for ""the Utah way"" to lead out on this important issue as it has on immigration reform, anti-discrimination and religious freedom.It acknowledges that rural areas will experience challenges as the state becomes less dependent on fossil fuels and asks government leaders to invest in and develop those parts of the Beehive State.The document also encourages businesses and citizens to adhere to the mileposts enumerated in the Utah Roadmap: Positive Solutions to Climate and Air Quality.U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, called the ""warming of the planet"" one of the three great challenges of the first half of this century, and the only one the Beehive State can directly impact and work to solve.Romney introduced New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, who delivered an address on ""COVID-19, Climate and Our Opportunity.""""There's a vice presidential debate happening in Salt Lake City today - that's a pretty big thing,"" Friedman said. ""But you know what I think? I think it's the second most important thing happening in Salt Lake City today. I think your compact is really the most important thing. It's something that's going to last.""He said he realized just recently that for the past 20 years of his career, he has been covering myriad ""pandemics,"" though not all have been biological. He covered a geopolitical pandemic during the events and fallout of 9/11, a financial pandemic with the recession of 2008 and now a biological pandemic in COVID-19.""And coming to a theater near you is an atmospheric pandemic called climate change,"" he said.What he's noticed about all four ""pandemics"" is that warnings precede the catastrophe.""In 1993, you'll recall that a man called Ramzi Yousef tried to blow up the World Trade Center in New York,"" he said. ""That was the warning heart attack, and on 9/11, we got the full coronary.""Friedman called the collapse of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund in 1998 the warning before the 2008 recession, just as the SARS virus in 2002 was the warning before COVID-19.People are now living through the events that will herald future climate disasters, he said.""Everyday we are getting warning heart attacks about climate change, whether it's wildfires, whether it's extreme weather,"" he said. ""It's telling us that this is going to be the next pandemic, and beware, with this pandemic, there is no peaking. Coronavirus peaks; climate change doesn't peak ... There's no herd immunity to climate change. There's just an endless pounding on the herd.""He suggests a six-step process to help change people's behavior and mitigate the effects of climate change:Name it: One of the largest problems with going ""green"" is that the word carries a negative connotation in many people's minds.""One of the problems with the word green, over the years, is the people who named it actually were people who kind of hated it.""Friedman has since tried to change the connotation of the word to ""geostrategic, geopolitical, capitalistic, innovative, patriotic.""""Green is the new red, white and blue.""Frame it: To get people from all ideologies working together, Friedman suggested framing the issue of climate change in a context that everyone can agree on: economics and financial opportunity.""Who here believes that America can still be the world's leading economy, let alone the world's most powerful nation, if we don't lead the next great global industry?"" he said.""Clean energy, energy efficiency, clean water, clean air, clean transport, clean power has to be the next great global industry. ... Otherwise we're going to be a bad biological experiment.""Scale it: ""There's, in my view, only one thing as big as Mother Nature and that's father greed - the marketplace,"" Friedman said. ""The only thing that can actually rival the power of Mother Nature is the market. And if you aren't leveraging the market to give you the scale you need, then you will never, ever, seriously be able to address climate change.""Shape and bend it: Friedman suggests incentivizing the market to reward companies that value clean air and climate friendly solutions.He wants the larger countries of the world to focus on the ""zeros"": zero net-energy buildings, zero waste manufacturing, zero carbon grid and zero emissions transportation.All of these can be leveraged with the right incentives and correct standards, he said.""The technologies are already here to do it,"" he said. ""It is now cheaper to save the Earth than destroy it. And it's also going to be more profitable.""Conserve it: Remaining conscientious of nature and wildlife will be a key to sustainability in the future, Friedman said, regardless of the increase in renewable energy sources.Inspire it: Friedman said he wishes that U.S. leaders would devote more of their campaigns to the climate and sustainability.""If I had any wish for President Trump or Vice President Biden in this race, if I had been running, my agenda would have been built around clean energy,"" he said. ""We don't need a space race now. We need an Earth race. We are in an Earth race. Which country, which state in America can develop the most climate friendly policies and clean tech solutions?"""
"15","Article 15","From new green jobs to environmental concerns about wind farms - and increased attention on alternative energy from both presidential campaigns - Colorado is viewing ""green"" jobs as a viable chance to grow the economy.Gov. Bill Ritter launched the new energy economy when he took office, and green jobs could prove to be the bright spot amid the economic gloom. And as gas prices rose to record highs during the summer months, other energies proved enticing - including politically risky nuclear energy.Congress renewed tax credits for wind and solar energy as part of the $700 billion bailout of the nation's financial system.The tax credits mean job creation, said Fred Crowley, senior instructor at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs College of Business and Administration.""The credit crunch isn't going to be a major issue for this industry,"" he said. ""The financing is going to work itself out, and I see some good things coming from that segment of the market. ""Crowley points to Vestas Wind Systems, a company that makes wind turbines. Vestas has a plant in northern Colorado and another is scheduled to open in Pueblo, which leaves Colorado Springs manufacturing companies in a very good position, Crowley said.""Pueblo is too small a community to do everything, all the secondary manufacturing jobs,"" he said. ""And Colorado Springs is the next biggest city. I think we're going to see some job creation - manufacturing jobs, which pay better than retail or service jobs. ""Vestas will employ 400 to 500 workers in Pueblo, and about 150 secondary jobs should be created.The alternative energy industry is one that isn't expected to contract, unlike other more traditional market segments, said Tom Dean, economist at Colorado State University.""It's a smaller percentage of the economy,"" he said. ""But it's still a very important part - the entrepreneurial segment will keep growing, as well as the manufacturing segment. And it's for a number of reasons. ""Dean said the industry always grows during years in which tax credits encourage expansion. That growth leads to jobs - and Colorado is situated to have many of the jobs from the industry, thanks to Amendment 37, which requires major utilities to get 20 percent of their energy from alternative sources.""So you have an increase in the number of people going out and putting photovoltaic cells on homes and businesses,"" he said. ""That's another way jobs are created. ""Wind energy grew 45 percent during 2007, and is responsible for 116,000 new jobs and $19 billion in investment. Wind represents 30 percent of new power created in the United States, for a total of 5,200 megawatts. Solar is a smaller piece of the energy industry - representing only 1 percent of the mix. But the United States ranks fourth in the world in terms of solar power, and solar manufacturing - creation of photovoltaic cells and solar panels for both homes and business grew 74 percent last year.But the industry is facing obstacles.""Things are a little shaky right now, with the credit markets being so tight,"" said Julie Clendenin, spokeswoman for the American Wind Energy Association. ""We're seeking more domestic manufacturing, trying to keep manufacturing in the United States. It's too early to tell if the markets will lighten, but so far the projects announced for 2009 are going ahead. ""The solution to the current energy crisis won't happen quickly, which could give companies focused on providing renewable alternatives to oil and natural gas time to gain a foothold.But securing a share of the increasingly competitive energy market won't be easy.""Every company has its own reasons for being against the other technologies,"" said Bob Duffy, chairman of the political science department at Colorado State University. ""Just look at the backlash against ethanol. ""As more farmers switch to producing corn for ethanol, food prices have risen - resulting in a backlash against using corn as a biofuel.""It's just a response to the market,"" Duffy said. ""There's a push to create an alternate to ethanol - but there are other reasons people make this claim. They want their own pet idea to move forward. ""The National Commission on Energy Policy has tried to fill the void left by Congress and the president - saying they ""rejected the proposition that uncertainty justifies inaction in the face of significant risks. ""The commission advocates focusing on conservation and growing traditional global resources, while raising money to develop new sources by selling tradable permits that limit carbon dioxide emissions. It also has recommended using advanced coal technologies, next-generation nuclear technology and renewable resources to generate electricity and transportation fuel.Nuclear power is again being touted as an alternative to coal-fired power plants - but not everyone is enamored with the idea.President George Bush has asked for $302 million for the Department of Energy's advance fuel cycle initiative, which would develop technologies to meet nuclear energy production while satisfying requirements for a controlled nuclear materials management system.Dr. Jim McNeil, head of the physics department at the Colorado School of the Mines, said that nuclear power is the answer to generating electricity without a carbon foot print.""If you believe that carbon dioxide is the primary culprit in global climate change, then I believe we have to have it all - wind, solar and nuclear,"" he said. ""But we have no excess storage capacity with solar or wind, at least not yet. That leaves nuclear. ""But the time it takes to get a nuclear plant up and running isn't the only concern.""Waste is an issue,"" McNeil said. ""My view is that it's a solvable problem, but it is one that is primarily political. It's a NIMBY (not in my back yard) issue. There are great places in Nevada to store waste - but no politician will survive if they agree to put it there. ""The primary sources of nuclear waste are plutonium, uranium and californium, which are toxic and can be used to make dirty bombs. But spent fuel rods can now be reused.""We have new technology - generation four technology - that uses active fuel cycle and burns the waste again. It's controversial, but it does work. ""In generation four technology, power plants take the waste and reprocess it. They do not separate the plutonium.Currently, U.S. nuclear policy is one-time use, he said, which means 95 percent of the energy is wasted.""One billion years ago, there was a natural nuclear reactor in a mine called Oklo,"" McNeil said. ""It burned for 1 million years in the jungle, no containment, no confinement. When French miners realized that there was no more Plutonium 235, they investigated, learned about the event. And they discovered that radio-nuclides had only traveled about 8 feet in a billion years. Nature has shown it can be done. Nuclear waste can be confined geologically for a very long period of time. You just have to find the political will to do it. ""But nuclear waste must be transported to be disposed of, and that's where Blade's largest concerns lie.""There have been some talks with Russians about storing nuclear waste in their country,"" he said. ""I think it's a huge security risk to transport it inside the United Sates - but a larger one to ship it out of the country. There is definitely a major security risk associated with nuclear waste storage. ""The push to replace coal-fired power plants with nuclear facilities hasn't taken root because of simple economics - but that might be changing.""It's expensive on the front end,"" said Dr. Jim McNeil, head of the physics department at the Colorado School of the Mines. ""Companies have to borrow a great deal of money with no return on that investment until they finish the building. And since nuclear power plants are going to bring lawsuits, it can cost a bloody fortune. ""But construction costs are falling, he said.During the 1970s, nuclear power plants were built from unique designs.Now, there are modular facilities, built in factories and shipped in units to the sites.""That reduces costs by standardizing the plants,"" McNeil said. ""It's just far more efficient. And if it's built in modules, then the companies can reap the benefit from power even before it's completely built out. ""However, safety still remains an issue.The Chernobyl melt-down had a chilling effect on nuclear power plant production in the United States, but McNeill said the problem has been solved by modern technology.""In Denver, there's a USGS facility that has a small reactor, a research reactor, that is created to go from stasis power to a spike up to 1,000 megawatts without meltdown,"" he said. ""It can't go critical. It's an excellent example, a dramatic example of passively safe reactor design. ""The United States doesn't have a single, coherent energy policy, but in the face of rising oil and natural gas prices, states are working to implement renewable programs.""In Colorado and Texas, we're focusing on wind because we have a lot of it,"" said Bob Duffy, chairman of the political science department at Colorado State University. ""In Florida, they're focusing on solar. Some where else might focus on hydro power. ""But one source of energy that probably isn't going to be an option is nuclear power.""The nation is really behind the power curve on nuclear power plants,"" said Bob Pomery, an attorney at Holland & Hart. ""And the demand for the parts and the expertise is high globally. Other nations have been moving forward much more aggressively than we have, and that's created a skyrocketing demand to build new plants. It's something that's going to cost us a lot to build. ""Gov. Bill Ritter has focused Colorado's economic policy on emerging energy sources. The state's goal is to generate 20 percent of energy from renewable resources, and both wind and solar are making headway.But the fledgling technologies face their share of backlash, with each trying to gain the upper hand in market share while combating big oil companies.""Oil companies aren't going to go away,"" Duffy said. ""They aren't going to say, 'OK, solar, wind and ethanol companies - you take over now. You were right. ' They're going to fight for their subsidies, their profits and they're going to fight for their tax breaks. ""Wind energy is one of the fastest growing industries in the nation, but it is facing sharp criticism from an unlikely source: environmental groups.Colorado ranked second nationwide for completing wind farm projects during 2007, and reports show the Colorado projects bring an additional capacity of 776 megawatts of power to the state. Only Texas, with 1,618 megawatts of power, added more wind energy to the electric grid last year.Colorado's wind farm industry is growing in large part because of Amendment 37, which requires utility companies to get 20 percent of their energy from renewable sources during the next decade. Xcel, which powers Denver and Pueblo, buys all the wind power that is currently available in the state.New installations increased by 45 percent last year, ""shattering all previous records,"" according to the American Wind Energy Association in its third quarter market report.Supporters see wind power as the first clean, renewable, domestic power source to reach maturity. Many in the industry believe wind power will supply 20 percent of electric needs by 2020.But the advantages don't mean that everyone appreciates - or supports - energy generated by wind farms. Some groups claim the wind farms are unsightly and some environmental groups are raising concerns about small birds, large raptors and bats - as well as hoofed animals like antelope and elk.""We just don't know what the long-term effects will be - and we don't know what the difference will be on wildlife if there are a thousand turbines instead of just one,"" said Ken Wilson, wildlife biologist and professor at Colorado State University.While wind energy seems benign, Wilson points out that water energy was once considered the cleanest energy of all - and then the effects on fish and other wildlife dependent on free-flowing rivers was recognized.""And then, of course, you have the aesthetics,"" he said. ""Some people don't want to look at a wind farm, just like many want to see white water in a canyon instead of a huge hydroelectric dam. ""Wilson said any change to the ecology and habitat can be a danger to wildlife.""There is no simple little equation that says this energy is clean and harmless,"" he said. ""We just need more study done before we put these wind farms in places that could harm the wildlife. """
