"1","Article 1","IT HIT 102 DEGREES IN THE CITY during the recent heat wave - and 27 people died from that heat.Though some said the recent scorcher was just the regular seasonal summer patterns, others suggest global warming is at fault.Indeed, a study published in the journal Science just last week showed that Greenland's ice cap is melting into the oceans three times faster than it did just three years ago.You can play a role in fighting global warming by investing in companies that are doing something to combat it, said Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a coalition that pushes publicly traded companies to clean up their act.American businesses, which were slower to pay attention to the global warming threat than overseas competitors, are revving up and reacting.""Ever since Hurricane Katrina, people have decided global warming is here and now - and they need to do something about it,"" Lubber said.Some firms are cutting back on their own consumption of fossil fuels and reducing their emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.Others are helping to support the development of technologies that will reduce air pollution.Goldman Sachs is pouring $1 billion into wind power and bio-fuels, Lubber said. Other Wall Street investment banks like J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup are doing similar investing.Picking stocks solely based on the company's efforts to help combat global warming without considering the bigger environmental picture could be problematic.For example, J.P. Morgan Chase was once considered an ecological villain for lending to projects that destroy rain forests.Now, however, the Rainforest Action Network, which organized protests against the firm, has given the banking giant a clean bill of health.""We consider them to be a good actor at this point,"" said Sam Haswell of the activist group.Conglomerate General Electric, also an environmental villain for legally dumping poisonous PCBs in the Hudson River between the 1940s and 1970s, is now a good stock pick because of its ""Ecoimagination"" initiative - which calls for development of a dozen products like locomotive engines that are diesel-electric hybrids, some analysts said.GE said it plans to double its investment in these clean-energy technologies to $1.5 billion a year by 2010.Lubber also suggested shares of Alcoa, whose goal is to make 50% of its products from recycled aluminum by 2020. This manufacturer has successfully reduced its emissions of perfluorocarbons and is working to cut them further. These gases have a global-warming intensity that's more than 6,000 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.Like J.P. Morgan and GE, chemical company DuPont has also emerged from the shadows of questions about its environmental policies.DuPont was the world's largest producer of chlorofluorocarbons, which tore a hole in the ozone layer. And it was successfully sued for poisoning the water near its now-closed blasting cap factory in Pompton Lakes, N.J.Now, DuPont is trying to be one of the good guys - developing refrigerants that are environmentally friendly, and creating plastics and fibers made of corn instead of petroleum.Baxter International is a holding in the Pax World Balanced Fund, said Anita Green, the vice president of social research at Pax World Funds. This medical-device maker was a founder of the Chicago Climate Exchange, where businesses buy and sell credits to offset their greenhouse gas emissions.The Pax World High-Yield Fund owns bonds from the FPL Energy National Wind Portfolio.FPL stands for Florida Power & Light - an electric utility whose FPL Energy subsidiary is into modern technology.It's America's largest builder of wind farms, which are fields full of windmills. And for a pure play on alternative-energy technology, Green suggested stock from Ballard Power Systems, which makes fuel cells.SIDEBAR: CHECK OUT WHAT YOU OWNWhat about the stocks you already own?Activist Web sites make it easy to check whether your investments support companies that fight global warming - or make it worse.nThe Carbon Disclosure Project - at  - keeps tabs on the greenhouse gas emissions of more than 1,900 companies.nInvestor coalition Ceres - at  - tracks publicly traded companies' strategies - or lack thereof - for dealing with global warming.

"2","Article 2","Steven Davis of the University of California, Davis, and Robert Socolow of Princeton (best known for his work  into            ) have written             a valuable new paper in Environmental Research Letters showing the value of shifting from tracking annual emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants to weighing the full amount of carbon dioxide that such plants, burning coal or gas, could emit during their time in service.This makes sense because of the long lifetime of these plants once built - typically 40 years or so - and the long lifetime of carbon dioxide once released. (I'd love to see some data visualization experiments on this idea from Adam Nieman, building on his work  from cities and the like.)Here's Davis's ""video abstract"" (the transcript is appended at the end of this post, along with a rich discussion of the paper's findings and implications):[Video:  ]The opening section of the paper is remarkably clear and is worth posting here (minus footnotes and the like):Each year, governments and firms estimate and report CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels, and their efforts to slow climate change are measured against these annual emissions. Ultimately, though, the magnitude of warming we experience will not be determined by emissions in any one year, but by cumulative CO2 emissions. Thus, climate scientists and energy-economic modelers have developed hundreds of plausible scenarios of future emissions and used them to identify emissions pathways that might achieve climate policy goals. Such scenarios are powerful tools for connecting emissions and warming to trajectories of population growth, economic development, and energy use. However, these trajectories are constrained by tremendous socio-economic inertia (e.g., existing energy, transport and built infrastructures) that limits the rate at which CO2 emissions can be reduced and climate change avoided.In 2010, Davis et al [  ] quantified an important component of socio-economic inertia by estimating the future emissions expected from all existing fossil fuel-burning infrastructure worldwide, naming these 'committed' emissions. That paper provided a single data point (commitments as of 2009), but lacked the context perhaps most important to policymakers: how these committed emissions have changed over time. Here we provide that context. We show that, despite international efforts to reduce CO2 emissions, total remaining commitments in the global power sector have not declined in a single year since 1950 and are in fact growing rapidly (by an average of 4% per year 2000-2012).The annual 'commitment accounting' that we demonstrate here offers policymakers an opportunity to evaluate historical trends and to quantify the long-term consequences of current actions in a new way.Environmental Research Web has posted  which explains how it grew out of earlier work by Davis and others (           ). This quote from Davis is particularly helpful:""One of the things that makes climate change such a difficult problem is that it lacks immediacy,"" Steven Davis of the University of California, Irvine, told environmentalresearchweb. ""It's going to have huge impacts in the long run, but its effects on our day-to-day lives seem small. The way we've been tracking carbon-dioxide emissions reinforces this remoteness: the annual emissions we monitor are small relative to the cumulative emissions that will cause large temperature increases. The alternative we present, what we call commitment accounting, helps by quantifying the long-run emissions related to investment decisions made today.""I sought reactions from a host of energy and climate analysts, kicking things off with this query and thought (some email shorthand is cleaned up):You are probably aware of ""Commitment Accounting of CO2 Emissions,"" a valuable new Socolow/Davis paper (building on, 2010).Given the  in developing countries, the other long-term effect of expanded coal-powered generation is accrued wealth and economic growth (along with            , of course). You could call it a             commitment.It'd be interesting to visualize all of this side by side with the emissions commitment in some way.I think this emerging form of emissions accounting provides a valuable way to show how the growing coal (and natural gas) greenhouse-gas emissions commitment will play out, but - because of the competing social and economic values embedded in that extracted energy, along with the  poor countries use against established fossil-powered industrial giants - I'm not sure it leads to a more effective strategy for cutting those emissions.I'd love to include your thoughts on this, including links to relevant background that bolsters your points.... On complex issues the best way to pinpoint ""reality"" is through discourse. As in celestial navigation, the more ""lines of position,"" the tighter the resulting area on the chart.(Please excuse the acronyms below. For now, please use Google to find definitions. I don't have time at the moment to include explanatory links.), an energy-focused economist at McGill, was first to reply:Without taking anything away from the importance of the Davis-Socolow contribution, your suggestion that we should also look at the benefits of the electricity generated is, in my opinion, dead on. The world as a whole (especially the emerging/developing country component) is going to require increased energy consumption for the foreseeable (and likely more distant) future. That that energy, however produced, provides enormous benefits cannot be deniedThe important question is how the world's huge and growing energy requirements are going to be met. Hoffert et al (1998) [  ] provided what still is the clearest framework for establishing the huge magnitude of the energy technology challenge to meeting a growing energy commitment-a challenge measured in terawatts not gigawatts. That challenge has been largely ignored, with the policy focus placed on emissions and emissions reduction and the political will to reduce them, without due regard to the current limits on alternative low carbon energy technologies. The failure to address the Hoffert et al energy technology question is reflected in the fact that since 2000 (and including 2013) the share of global energy consumption accounted for by fossil fuels has remained essentially constant at 86.5-87.0%. (Here I use BP Energy Statistics.) globally, the ""progress"" made with non-hydro renewables is offset by a decline in energy from nuclear power plants. Not surprisingly, the carbon content of energy is the same in 2013 as it was in the early 1990s and actually rose a little since 2000.While Davis and Socolow are clearly right that the climate has not benefited from the lack of progress on the energy technology front, billions of people, particularly in the emerging country/developing world, have benefited substantially from the energy generated. As far as I can see the standoff will continue until there is recognition that climate change is first and foremost an energy technology problem, one that cannot be solved/resolved without a great deal more than emission reduction pledges.of the Natural Resources Defense Council was concerned that I was using too wide a brush:You say- ""Given the  in developing countries, the other long-term effect of expanded coal-powered generation is accrued wealth and economic growth...""This statement conflates three things: electrification services, electric generating capacity, and coal-fired generating capacity.  The implication is that there is a serious tradeoff between constraining cumulative global CO2 emissions and meeting the needs of developing countries for increased electrification services.  Truth is, the CO2 commitment from new generating capacity in the poorest countries will be small, even if they build mostly coal.  But building mostly coal is not the only path they or other countries need to follow to expand electrification services.  When the world's wealthiest countries begin to take climate protection seriously, there are ways in which any incremental costs of pursuing a low-carbon electrification path in poorer countries can be shared based on all countries' strategic interests in avoiding a disrupted climate.Steve Davis, one of the paper authors, added this:Dave is right to point out that the largest commitments we've quantified are only distantly related to meeting the energy needs of the underserved. The big commitments reflect coal-based industrialization and energy-intensive development whose value is more questionable given the climate and health impacts entailed and availability of cleaner and more energy-efficient options.I responded with this question:But given urbanization trends, particularly, centralized power production and the jobs and output that come with industrialization are certainly a big factor for many governments, right?Davis replied:Perhaps, but that's the distant relation. We point out that the world built 89 GW [gigawatts, or billion watts] of coal-fired capacity per year 2010-2012. That's roughly equal to the entire generating capacity of sub-Saharan Africa being added every year. These plants are supporting large-scale industrialization that is a world apart from providing basic energy services, even if one dreams of the other. They're related just as the merits of different graduate schools are in the minds of parent teaching their toddlers to read.Chris Green responded to Davis and Hawkins:Yes, Dave is talking about the underserved in the sense of the poorest many of whom are not even hooked up to the grid. But my comment addresses the huge energy demands as people move beyond the very poorest. Think here of the many countries, especially the populous ones, that are industrializing and urbanizing. They inevitably will require a lot of energy, if for no other reason than that materials for construction (steel, cement, flat glass, aluminum, copper) are hugely energy intensive - with energy intensities an order of magnitude higher than that for most other manufactured goods. Think too about the demand for appliances including air conditioning as people move into the middle class. These are key factors in the rise in energy demand and the observed increase in fossil fuel generating capacity.I also take issue with Dave's suggestion of good alternatives to fossil fuel generated energy. With the possible exception of nuclear energy, which to date has faced numerous hurdles, there certainly aren't on anything like the scale required. And little has changed in this respect since Hoffert et al, 1998.at the Breakthrough Institute joined the general discussion:Thanks for the note. As you know, Breakthrough and our colleagues at the Consortium for Science, Policy & Outcomes (and development/energy experts from across the world) addressed this issue in our April report  As Professor Green mentioned, the singular focus on emissions is pervasive, and in some cases understandable (for instance, comparing national emissions accounts - measured in MTCO2 - is often much easier than harmonizing and comparing trade-adjusted energy consumption - measured variously in Mtoe, GWhs, bbls, EJs, etc etc). But in the case of energy in emerging economies, the laser focus on emissions is inappropriate.There has been some movement towards a ""gigawatt-hours commitment,"" as you write. This is the Decade of Sustainable Energy for All, after all. Unfortunately, the dominant frameworks used for understanding the energy access challenge - including those of the UN and IEA - are pretty clearly unacceptable. There are two main problems. The first is an almost exclusive focus on basic household electricity access, often in remote areas, without attendant attention to urbanizing populations, industrializing economies, etc. The second is the scale of ambition. As most on this thread will know, energy access is defined at 250-500kWh/year. This compares to the average German consumption of over 7000kWh/yr. With German levels of consumption, a planet of 9-10 billion in midcentury would require three times as much energy as the world does today.If we don't start with this very basic, fundamental point, then we're not really having a discussion about energy development or climate change. Again, as Professor Green writes, these realities are commonly ignored, even though folks like Marty Hoffert, Nathan Lewis, Richard Smalley, and John Holdren pointed them out over a decade ago.Morgan Bazilian and Roger Pielke, Jr.  what it actually take for sub-Saharan Africa to reach levels of energy consumption enjoyed by South Africans or Americans. China, India, Indonesia, South Africa, and other emerging countries have of course developed largely with coal-fired power. Africa appears poised to             straight towards large hydro and natural gas. No one has yet conceived of a feasible energy development strategy - to power cities, industries, major infrastructure, etc - with renewables or nuclear as the dominant energy sources. Fortunately, a lot of the much-needed work on delivering truly scalable and affordable zero-carbon alternative is being done in the developing world itself. China is pursuing nuclear, solar, and carbon capture at a much greater scale than most Western economies. There are several dozen other countries investing in next-generation nuclear technologies (along with things like renewables, shale gas, coal-to-gas, etc.) to power rapidly growing demand. If decarbonization is to remain a priority - as it should - the energy innovation momentum of the developing world must be captured and accelerated.I would finally recommend the work of Catherine Wolfram at UC Berkeley, who has both criticized the energy projections methods of the IEA and most recently introduced the very helpful framework of  populations, which are very near but unconnected to nascent electricity grids. While             have apparently decided that delivering energy access is a household event best pursued by developed-world charities, NGOs, and entrepreneurs, what we actually see with electricity is similar to what we see with food - good governance and political institutions are essential for equitable and abundant distribution.of the Rocky Mountain Institute weighed in:On the contrary, everything has changed since 1998, making Marty's paper even less relevant today. A few quick highlights, doubtless incomplete:- Half the new generating capacity the world has added since 2008 has been renewable. (In 2013, 68% of China's new capacity was renewable, the majority of it solar and wind; in Europe, 72%.)- In each of the past three years, the world invested >$250b investment in non-hydro renewables, adding >80 GW per year. Orders for central thermal plants continue to fade because they have no business case.- PV power is scaling faster than cellphones worldwide, and in concert with high end-use efficiency (e.g. LED lighting) has extraordinary potential to reach those with no electricity as well as in peri-urban areas.- China in 2012 increased electricity output more from non-hydro renewables than from all fossil-fueled and nuclear sources, and in 2013, added more PV capacity than the US had added since it invented PVs in 1954. RMI's Reinventing Fire: China collaboration with ERI, EF/C, and LBNL is turning up cost-effective practical potential to raise China's 2050 carbon productivity (GDP per unit of fossil fuel) by >=15x. The potential in India, where a revolution in efficiency and renewables is also emerging, may be even greater. Both these countries make more electricity from windpower than from nuclear power.- Unsubsidized US market prices in favorable US sites are ~$0.07/kWh for PV power and ~$0.04/kWh for windpower, with both falling rather rapidly, but already they beat new combined-cycle gas, even neglecting gas's ~$2/GJ price-volatility cost.- Grid integration of high-renewables mixes, for those paying attention, is now an interesting evolutionary opportunity, not a prohibitive technological or economic challenge. (See  for a short nontechnical summary of why no breakthrough in bulk electrical storage is needed.) Four EU countries not especially rich in hydropower got about half their 2013 electricity consumption from renewables-Spain 45%, Scotland 46%, Denmark >=47%, Portugal 58%-with excellent reliability and no additions of bulk storage.- Micropower-the Economist's term for renewables, less big hydro, plus cogeneration-now produces one-fourth of the world's electricity (>2x nuclear output); see RMI's July 2014 Micropower Database update for details.- Commonly mentioned renewable issues around land-use turned out to be a canard ().- Both globally and nationally, renewables excluding big hydro have scaled at least as fast as nuclear power ever did, and without its two-decade ""windup"" period of building the very demanding capabilities and complex institutions required.- Properly integrated renewables have emerged as a uniquely profitable and practical pathway to resilient grids that make big cascading blackouts impossible-without adding material cost (see Transform scenario in Reinventing Fire).- Although U.S. utilities typically pay ~$0.02-0.03/kWh for efficiency, RMI's empirically grounded Reinventing Fire synthesis showed in detail how to quadruple U.S. electric end-use efficiency at an average cost of ~$0.007/kWh (2009 $). The average IRR for 3-4x higher energy productivity in US buildings is 33%; for doubled energy productivity in US industry, 21%. Previous analyses show higher costs and smaller savings because they left so much out, including integrative design, which often turns diminishing into expanding returns to investments in energy efficiency.- The world is investing >$300b/y in energy efficiency (the electric fraction is unknown but significant), and some major economies like the US and Germany show pretty steady declines in electricity use even as their economies grow. US weather-adjusted electric intensity, for example, fell 3.4% in 2012 alone. It's probably reasonable to estimate that efficiency's annual addition to global electrical services is at least comparable to that of nonhydro renewables.- It is not essential for developing countries to repeat industrialized countries' historic trajectories: on the contrary, they can leapfrog in energy supply as many did in cellphones. Some are already doing exactly that. Experience teaches that waiting for the wires to reach the villages, bringing unaffordable thermal power, is impractical. The smart solution is to skip the wires, just as in telecomms, and go efficient/renewable/resilient/distributed.- In general, developing countries have lower end-use efficiency and have more infrastructure yet unbuilt, and they can more easily build right than fix later, so they have far more dynamic and capacious efficiency opportunities than industrialized countries.- As Ashok Gadgil and I showed ~23 years ago from World Bank data, investing in negawatts wherever they're cheaper than megawatts cuts by ~4 orders of magnitude (3 from intensity, 1 from velocity) the capital needed by the power sector - the most capital-intensive sector, gobbling about¼of all development capital. Such least-cost investment could turn that sector into a net exporter of capital to fund other development needs. That's the most powerful macroeconomic lever we know for global development; yet few finance ministers have ever heard of it.In short, convergent trends in renewable and distributed power, empowered customers, liberalized markets, transparent pricing, and radical end-use efficiency are building an energy future very different from the past. Powerful players are betting on this new horse, coming up fast on the outside. Those who can't see that horse will continue to lose value, because their preferences have more cost and financial risk than investors wish to fund. These market forces will ultimately prove more important than policy, international agreements, or the inertia of those with old ideas and trapped equity.I haven't time to enter a protracted discussion about these facts and ideas, but was surprised by their absence from the thread, and hope their injection may prove helpful.Chris Green responded to Lovins's arguments:It is hard to square the energy facts presented by Amory Lovins with those I have garnered from BP Energy Statistics. While the statistics here (see below) focus on primary energy consumption and those presented by Lovins focus on electricity (a component of final energy) the differences are stark. Here are just a few of the differences:1. Lovins says renewables (including small hydro and co-generation) account for 47, 58, and 46% of electricity consumption in Denmark, Portugal and Spain, respectively. But non-hydro renewables (NHRs) and all hydro accounted for only 5.7%, 28% and 19%, respectively, of primary energy consumption in 2013 in these three countries. If only NHRs are considered the percentages would be much lower.2. Globally, NHRs accounted for 2.2% of primary energy consumption in 2013-up from 0.5% in 2000. If all hydro is added in the share in 2013 rises to 8.9%.3. All of the gain in share of NHRs share since 2000, was offset by the decline in share of nuclear.4. Lovins claims regarding the contribution of NHRs to electricity consumption in China in 2013 must contend with the fact that the NHRs increased by only 9.4 million million tonnes of oil equivalent (mTOE) between 2012-2013 compared to 100 mTOE for fossil fuels.As indicated in an earlier intervention, low carbon energy has not made any inroads into the 86.5-87% dominant share of fossil fuels in global energy consumption since 2000. What NHRs have gained has been at the expense of nuclearI would note that Alex Trembath's useful intervention to this discussion provides insight into why we can expect global energy consumption will continue to grow, and tangentially why so much of that energy will be supplied by fossil fuels without an major breakthroughs in energy technology.Trembath built on Green's comment:Indeed, Professor Green, the numbers for even 2013 are not nearly as optimistic as Dr. Lovins suggests. Over 2012, 2013 consumption of different energy sources rose by the following amounts, measured in Mtoe (note these are primary energy, not only electricity):Oil: 46.1Gas: 34.1Coal: 103.0Nuclear: 3.3Hydro: 22.2Wind: 24.0Solar: 6.9(Source: BP 2014)There really ought to be a collegial rule against discussing energy consumption trends without mentioning capacity factor, which explain why 68% of capacity added in 2013 was renewable but a much smaller minority of added generation was renewable. Capacity factor of course also explains why renewables excluding large hydro (and excluding CHP) account for almost twice the installed capacity of global nuclear, yet nuclear in 2013 still generated about 20% more electricity than all those sources combined. These graphs are taken from RMI's Micropower Database; the first is capacity and the second is generation:Of course we see here also how essential including cogeneration (typically combined heat and power using natural gas) is for drawing such optimistic conclusions about micro generation.I'm also not sure along what metric Dr. Lovins finds that "" globally and nationally, renewables excluding big hydro have scaled at least as fast as nuclear power ever did."" As this analysis by my colleagues shows, the best cases of nuclear have outpaced the best cases of nuclear when the metric is added generation divided by national population:Of course some of the fastest energy, not carbon, transitions have been with natural gas. The UK went from 0% natural gas for electricity in 1990 to 40% in 2000. The US deployed over 250 GW of natural gas generation capacity in the last 20 years, and here's what our own energy transition has looked like:Certain subsidized and unsubsidized renewables projects can come in at low cost, and we should celebrate these and learn from their successes. But while Dr. Lovins cites 7c/kWh as a best case for solar, the EIA still finds average LCOE of solar at 13c/kWh, higher than advanced nuclear and, of course, higher than natural gas. Wind does appear to have reached an all time low, settling in 4-6c/kWh unsubsidized, as the recent LBNL report showed. However, it must be remembered that these technologies' value to the grid decreases, and integration cost increases, with higher penetration. This is from the work of Lawrence Berkeley National Labs:This dynamic is evident in Germany, where wholesale power prices are being depressed by must-dispatch, low-marginal cost renewables, but balancing this intermittency is causing retail power prices to rise, both from increasing FIT commitments, and increasingly with costs like capacity payments for baseload power stations and curtailment payments for excess renewables. Here's the results of a review of increasing integration costs from variable renewables:On the efficiency side of things,  and             have long requested that RMI better incorporate rebound effects into modeling future energy consumption patterns. For instance. In Reinventing Fire (RF), Lovins et al cite 2 studies finding transportation sector rebounds at 3 and 22 percent, but ultimately exclude transportation rebounds from their analysis (Sorrell 2007's survey and the European Commission's review find transpo rebound between 10 and 30 percent; Gavankar and Geyer 2010 identify long-term rebounds between 20 and 65 percent). RF uses 10 and 5 percent rebound for heating and cooling respectively, while Sorrell 2007 finds 10-30 percent for heating and 1-26 percent for cooling. RF rejects the idea of rebounds effects in industrial processes, while Saunders finds rebound in energy intensive industries like primary metals, utilities, manufacturing, and agriculture to be in the range of 20-35 percent. The IPCC and the IEA have recently begun to incorporate rebound effects into their analyses, largely at the behest of organizations like Breakthrough, UKERC, the European Commission, and vocal scholars like Harry Saunders, Steve Sorrell, Joyashree Roy, Dorothy Maxwell, and Karen Turner.I think it's clear from the above that the world still continues to rely primarily on fossil fuels for development and that even the richest economies are far from achieving significant scaling of renewables (or nuclear) for major decarbonization. Where renewables have scaled, they have brought national electricity prices right up with them. This is especially true for solar PV, where in Germany and Spain FIT payments have caused serious energy policy turmoil, and in the US, where net metering policies have caused public utility backlash against PV deployment in states like Arizona and California (a result of utilities being forced to pay 15-30ckWh for PV electricity instead of purchasing on the wholesale markets for 4-6c/kWh).To return to the point of Andy's original prompt. Renewables are expanding and their costs are declining, but isolated and contextless success stories don't help us understand the true scale of both the climate and energy development challenges. Drs. Davis and Socolow's intervention with the new paper is extremely helpful because it aims to reveal the scale of the challenge. While renewables continue to develop worldwide - and while countries as varied as US, UK, China, South Korea, Turkey, UAE, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Jordan, etc continue to develop nuclear - fossil still reigns. Now the deployment of fossil and coal generation in regions like sub-Saharan Africa is very likely a net positive for humanity, since a lack of modern electricity systems is largely what makes those locales most vulnerable to climate and other impacts in the first place. But again, if decarbonization of the global economy is the ultimate goal, then I think it's clear we still need answers to the cost and scalability of nuclear and renewables both large and small.At this point Rob Socolow, one of the paper authors, sought to be sure readers caught the main intent of the paper:It would be nice to flag what Steve Davis and I have contributed which we think is new.We are calling attention to a systematic neglect of capital investment decisions in the reporting rules related to climate change, relative to current emissions.We introduce a concept, ""committed emissions,"" and a methodology to quantify the carbon implications of capital investments.We show quantitatively that, for the global power sector in any recent year, two quantities are comparable: 1) current emissions that year from all power plants, and 2) ""committed emissions"" from plants that went on line that year - emissions that can be expected from these plants in the future (when we assume a 40 year lifetime).We take the concept of remaining committed emissions developed in Steve's 2010 paper with Caldeira and Matthews and work out the trajectory of that value for the global power sector each year over the past 60 years (the earlier paper reported the value for only a single recent year). We find that this index has never fallen, is over 300 GtO2 today and was 200 GtCO2 as recently as Year 2000.We recommend that ""committed emissions"" be incorporated prominently into energy analysis, scenario making, and climate policy.Burt Richter, the physics Nobelist and author of ""Beyond Smoke and Mirrors: Climate Change and Energy in the 21st Century,"" added this comment:Sorry to jump in late, but I have been away. I think of world energy demand as follows:Energy = (population) x (per capita income) x (energy/GDP)We know population is going up (UN mid-level projection is about 9.5 billion by 2050 and 10.5 by 2100), and the poor want to get rich while the rich don't want to get poor, so the only way to work on global energy demand is the last term which is really energy efficiency. If you want to worry about emissions, add another term (emission per unit energy) which is where clean energy comes in. I use ""clean"" rather than ""renewables"" because renewables is a term designed to exclude nuclear, big hydro, and large scale efficiency efforts. Taken with most projections for growth energy demand will be up by nearly a factor of 4 by 2100.What kind of energy is the question? The most recent authoritative numbers for the world that I can find are from the IEA and credit big hydro and combustibles with significant contributions to the total, while wind and solar are quite small. As for Amory's numbers, Denmark is insignificant of the world scale and is connected to the Scandinavian power grid so has lots of back up. Germany is not so connected and so already is having trouble with the stability of its grid. In discussions with Amory in the past I have always found it useful to ask for references for his numbers.As to the world's poorest countries, they contribute negligibly to emissions and to demand. Let them start up development in any way they can.Then came input from , who is best known for his time in research at Microsoft and as an inventor and investor, but has been an author on            :Burt's outlook is one that I share.If you think of energy usage from a ""rich world"" perspective where there is low growth in demand you can imagine the 21st century challenge to be one where we replace existing fossil fuel energy with clean (in Burt's sense) energy.But the reality is that the currently poor world is getting richer so by 2100 we need way more primary energy.  Today's entire infrastructure will be only ~25% of the picture.  The ~4X increase will be in the developing world which will put a huge premium on cost.As Burt asks, what will that be?   At present it is very hard to be optimistic that the new energy will be clean.  That isn't the current course.Amory appears to be far more optimistic than I am, based on numbers that I can't reconcile with the figures available to me., a professor of energy at the University of California, Berkeley, who happens to edit the journal in which the Davis-Socolow paper is published, offered some overarching thoughts:As Editor-in-Chief of Environmental Research Letters I am delighted to see this neat paper by Davis and Socolow generating this useful discussion.Commitment accounting as per Davis and Socolow is useful (I dispute that these facts are not widely known) but it is always useful to be reminded of the implications of our collective decisions today.The key point that Davis and Socolow make is that when we talk about stranded assets their measure puts this huge looming threat into a form that can easily become something the business community can assess in terms of risks.When I was at the World Bank my number one goal was to make as many multinational agencies perform life-cycle accounting of emissions on all of their current assets and future potential investments.This is a step that governments, companies, municipalities and others could commit to at, for example, the September 23Climate Summit in New York.Even for entities not ready to implement a price on carbon, simply making this accounting a business requirement would dramatically advance the calculation along the lines that Davis and Socolow recommend.As an example, the University of California system has committed to eliminating fossil fuel use by 2025 - a major task given our transportation footprint.One way to do this is to start with good, holistic accounting.We took a step there with a recent  where we show interactively the average footprint for each US zip code. (Yes, a finer-grained map is needed; that paper is next.)Second, a very simple directive that states, agencies, cities, and the federal government could do to bring the committed emissions into focus is to do that GHG life-cycle analysis along with other project assessments.In California, for example, we would recommend using the current market price of carbon GHG emissions (around $11/ton in CA), but this could arguably vary to the  or other reasonable values.From there, agencies, financial officers, CFOs would all know the long-term implications of their decisions.Kammen appended this thought focused on his years of work in developing countries:I'd like to add a bit on the developing nation aspects of this conversation.I have been working in Central America and East Africa for the last 30 years.I am also just back from far northern Kenya where I was working with the grid planning and the infrastructure for both on-grid wind energy (Africa's largest wind farm is begin built to take advantage of remarkable wind site and the transmission access provided by a new Kenya-Ethiopia linking line).  Photo over Lake Turkana with the wind site at upper right (construction begins this fall).Kenya's grid today is 1.8 GW, and the country's least-cost form of new energy is geothermal (8.5 cents/kWh) for which the economic resource is > 9 GW.Second, off-grid solar is fastest growing and largest component of new energy access in a country with 29% grid access today.  One company with which my lab has an NDA/MOU is the largest user of mobile online money in the country.Kenya is also on path to replace its hydropower dominated grid of today with one where wind and geothermal are the largest providers of energy (hydropower in the region is increasingly uncertain due to climate change).Kenya is not unique. Many nations have this clean energy capacity. This message gets lost all the time. 80%+ clean energy paths are not at all hard to find (we are doing assessment for 10 nations right now), and other researchers are doing similar things elsewhere.On and off-grid are both vital, and public-private partnerships and pure private sector investments are key.  We need to find ways to support locally directed efforts that meet these fully decarbonized local visions.Steve Davis circled back the prime points of the paper:Regardless of how well renewables are or are not doing, the point Rob and I are trying to make is that fossil infrastructure is still expanding in a big way: the total committed emissions represented by power plants is growing even faster than annual emissions.  Whether or not we share Amory's rosy outlook on renewables, these fossil commitments are inconsistent with a decline in emissions any time soon.Myhrvold reacted:This is a key point - the fossil infrastructure is still expanding.Ken Caldiera and I have done a lot of work recently in modeling atmospheric GHG concentration during switchover from fossil fuels to clean energy. A general lesson that comes from this work is that inertia in the climate system means that the ""hangover"" from emission lasts for decades. Radiative forcing due to greenhouse gases and global average temperature continue to rise for a long time.So even if you stopped emissions today, we would have climate impact for decades.But we are not stopping today - the fossil infrastructure is still expanding. The metric of ""committed emissions"" makes that clear.Indeed if one combined that metric with modeling results you could call it ""committed delta T"" - in effect power plant construction commits us to higher global average temperature.As promised, here's the transcript of Davis's video presentation on the work:Video Abstract for Commitment Accounting of CO2 Emissions, Davis and SocolowOne of the things that makes climate change an especially difficult problem is that, for the average policymaker, and certainly the average person, it lacks immediacy. As one psychologist puts it, ""Climate change may ruin your future, but it won't mess up your evening.""The fact that climate impacts are a threat in the long-run and will materialize slowly over time make it hard for us to get very excited about responding to the threat, no matter how devastating the impacts may turn out to be.The problem is, our instinct to wait and see is at odds with another characteristic of climate change, which is that it's a problem with huge inertia.There's a bit of physical inertia-it would take temperatures a few years to catch up with all the CO2 we've been dumping into the atmosphere even if we stopped today.But more importantly, there is a tremendous amount of social, economic and political inertia. We've spent nearly two centuries and tens of trillions of dollars worldwide building up the largest network of infrastructure that has ever existed to extract, process, and deliver fossil fuels and fossil energy to consumers. All of this long-lived infrastructure represents an enormous investment that won't be easy to walk away from.The idea behind the new paper my co-author Rob Socolow and I have written is that it's possible to estimate future GHG emissions that are locked-in by all the existing fossil infrastructure, what we call ""committed emissions."" Our paper demonstrates the concept of this commitment accounting by quantifying the CO2 emissions that are expected to come from now-existing power plants.Rather than tallying up CO2 emissions from power plants in the year they come out of the plant's smokestacks, we assume a typical plant lifetime of 40 years and allocate the lifetime emissions of each power plant to the year it was built.What we found is that the currently existing power plants around the world-unless they are retired early or retrofitted so that their emissions are captured-can be anticipated to emit roughly 300 billion tons of CO2 in the future. That's about 10 years worth of current emissions from existing power plants alone, and enough to put a big dent in the remaining budget of emissions we can dump into the atmosphere and still have a reasonable chance of avoiding 2 degrees C of warming relative to the preindustrial era.But even more daunting than this large amount of committed emissions, we found that total committed emissions grew by an average of 4% between 2000 and 2012 as we built more coal-fired power plants over that period than in any previous 12-year period.Power plants in the US, EU and India each represent about 10% of the current committed emissions, and the incredible expansion of coal-power in China shows up, as all these Chinese plants represent 42% of global committed emissions. Power plants in Japan, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Iran also have substantial and growing share of the world total.Now to be clear, ""committed"" doesn't mean ""unavoidable."" There's nothing to stop us from shuttering a brand new power plant or retrofitting it with carbon capture and storage technology, but of course there'd be costs associated with doing of either of those things. Once something is built and operating, there really is some commitment.SO, coming back to the issues of immediacy and inertia, our hope is that the sort of commitment accounting described and demonstrated in the paper will be taken up by other analysts and used to evaluate the long-run climate impacts of current capital investments, in turn allowing policymakers to confront these distant implications of their decisions in the present.Thanks for listening, and feel free to email me with questions about the paper or the concept of commitment accounting of GHG emissions."
"3","Article 3","Suppose that over the next decade or two the forecasts of global warming start to come true. Color has drained from New England's autumns as maple trees die, and the Baltimore oriole can no longer be found south of Buffalo. The Dust Bowl has returned to the Great Plains, and Arctic ice is melting into open water. Upheavals in weather, the environment and life are accelerating around the world.Then what?If global warming occurs as predicted, there will be no easy way to turn the Earth's thermostat back down. The best that most scientists would hope for would be to slow and then halt the warming, and that would require a top-to-bottom revamping of the world's energy systems, shifting from fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas to alternatives that in large part do not yet exist.""We have to face the fact this is an enormous challenge,"" said Dr. Martin I. Hoffert, a professor of physics at New York University.But interviews with scientists, environment advocates and industry representatives show that there is no consensus in how to meet that challenge. Some look to the traditional renewable energy sources: solar and wind. Others believe use of fossil fuels will continue, but that the carbon dioxide can be captured and then stored underground. The nuclear power industry hopes concern over global warming may help spur a revival.In an article in the journal Science last November, Dr. Hoffert and 17 other experts looked at alternatives to fossil fuels and found all to have ""severe deficiencies in their ability to stabilize global climate.""The scientists believe that technological fixes are possible. Dr. Hoffert said the country needed to embark on an energy research program on the scale of the Manhattan Project that built the atomic bomb during World War II or the Apollo program that put men on the moon.""Maybe six or seven of them operating simultaneously,"" he said. ""We should be prepared to invest several hundred billion dollars in the next 10 to 15 years.""But to even have a hope of finding a solution, the effort must begin now, the scientists said. A new technology usually takes several decades to develop the underlying science, build pilot projects and then begin commercial deployment.The authors of the Science paper expect that a smorgasbord of energy sources will be needed, and they call for intensive research on radical ideas like vast solar arrays orbiting Earth that can collect sunlight and beam the energy down. ""Many concepts will fail, and staying the course will require leadership,"" they wrote. ""Stabilizing climate is not easy.""The heart of the problem is carbon dioxide, the main byproduct from the burning of fossil fuels. When the atmosphere is rich in carbon dioxide, heat is trapped, producing a greenhouse effect. Most scientists believe the billions of tons of carbon dioxide released since the start of the Industrial Revolution are in part to blame for the one-degree rise in global temperatures over the past century. Carbon dioxide concentrations are now 30 percent higher than preindustrial levels.With rising living standards in developing nations, emissions of carbon dioxide are increasing, and the pace of warming is expected to speed up, too. Unchecked, carbon dioxide would reach twice preindustrial levels by midcentury and perhaps double again by the end of the century. That could force temperatures up by 3 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100, according to computer models.Because carbon dioxide is colorless, odorless and disperses immediately into the air, few realize how much spills out of tailpipes and smokestacks. An automobile, for example, generates perhaps 50 to 100 tons of carbon dioxide in its lifetime.The United States produces more carbon dioxide than any other country by far. Each American, on average, generates about 45,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year. That is about twice as much as the average person living in Japan or Europe and many times more than someone living in a developing country like Zimbabwe, China or Panama. (Even if the United States achieves President Bush's goal of an 18 percent reduction in the intensity of carbon dioxide emissions by 2012, the output of an average American would still far exceed that of almost anyone else in the world.)Even if all emissions stop, levels of carbon dioxide in the air will remain high for centuries as the Earth gradually absorbs the excess.Currently, the world's energy use per second is about 12 trillion watts -- which would light up 120 billion 100-watt bulbs -- and 85 percent of that comes from fossil fuels.Of the remaining 15 percent, nuclear and hydroelectric power each supply about 6.5 percent. The renewable energy sources often touted as the hope for the future -- wind and solar -- provide less than 2 percent.In March, Dr. Hoffert and two colleagues reported in Science that to limit the temperature increase to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, non-carbon-dioxide-emitting sources would have to generate 7 trillion to 25 trillion watts by midcentury, 4 to 14 times as much as current levels. That is roughly equivalent to adding a large emissions-free power plant every day for the next 50 years.And by the end of the century, they wrote, at least three-quarters and maybe all of the world's energy would have to be emission-free.No existing technology appears capable of filling that void. The futuristic techology might be impractically expensive. Developing a solar power satellite, for example, has been estimated at more than $200 billion.Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham cited the Science paper from last November in a speech at the American Academy in Berlin two months ago. Mr. Abraham said that merely setting limits and timetables on carbon dioxide like those in the Kyoto Protocol could not by themselves solve global warming.""We will also need to develop the revolutionary technologies that make these reductions happen,"" Mr. Abraham said. ""That means creating the kinds of technologies that do not simply refine current energy systems, but actually transform the way we produce and consume energy.""Too Far AwaySome long-hoped-for options will almost certainly not be ready. Fusion -- producing energy by combining hydrogen atoms into helium, the process that lights up the sun -- has been heralded for decades as a potentially limitless energy source, but scientists still have not shown it can be harnessed practically. Experimental fusion reactors do not yet produce more power than they take to run.Increased energy efficiency -- like better-insulated buildings, more efficient air-conditioners, higher mileage cars -- is not a solution by itself, but it could buy more time to develop cleaner energy.The much-talked-about hydrogen economy, in which gasoline-powered engines are replaced by fuel cells, is also not a solution. It merely shifts the question to what power source is used to produce the hydrogen.Today, most hydrogen is made from natural gas, a process that produces carbon dioxide that is then released into the air. Hydrogen can also be produced by splitting apart water atoms, but that takes more energy than the hydrogen will produce in the fuel cell. If the electricity to split the water comes from the coal-fired power plant, then a hydrogen car would not cut carbon dioxide emissions.Exploiting What's HereA fundamental problem remains: how to produce electricity without carbon dioxide.Hydroelectric power has reached its limits in most parts of the world; there are no more rivers to dam.Nuclear power is a proven technology to generate large amounts of electricity, but before it could be expanded, the energy industry would have to overcome longstanding public fears that another accident, like those at Three Mile Island or Chernobyl, will occur. Solutions also need to be found for disposing of radioactive spent fuel and safeguarding it from terrorists.Marvin Fertel, senior vice president of the Nuclear Energy Institute, an industry group, said warming had become such a worrythat some environmental groups were becoming amenable to new nuclear plants. ""In private, that's what we get from them,"" he said.Researchers at the Electric Power Research Institute in Palo Alto, Calif., espouse a major expansion of nuclear power, coupled with a switch from gasoline to hydrogen to power cars and trucks. Electricity from the nuclear plants would split water to produce hydrogen, and then cables made of superconductors would distribute both electricty and hydrogen, which would double as coolant for the cables, across the country.""I think in 30 to 50 years there will be systems like this,"" said Dr. Chauncey Starr, the institute's founder and emeritus president. ""I think the advantages of this are sufficient to justify it.""In the short run, fossil fuels will still be widely used, but it is still possible to control carbon dioxide.In his Berlin speech, Mr. Abraham highlighted two projects the Energy Department was working on: carbon sequestration -- the capturing of carbon dioxide before it is emitted and storing it underground -- and FutureGen, a $1 billion prototype coal power plant that will produce few emissions. The plant will seek to demonstrate by 2020 how to convert coal to hydrogen on a commercial scale that will then be used to generate electricity in fuel cells or turbines. The waste carbon dioxide would be captured and stored.The technology for injecting carbon dioxide is straightforward, but scientists need better knowledge on suitable locations and leak prevention.Sequestration, however, will probably not be cost-effective for current power plants. The filters for capturing carbon dioxide from the exhaust gas will by themselves consume 20 percent to 30 percent of the power plant's electricity.Renewing RenewablesSolar is still a future promise. The cost of energy from solar cells has dropped sharply in the past few decades. One kilowatt-hour of electricity -- the energy to light a 100-watt bulb for 10 hours -- used to cost several dollars when produced by solar cells. Now it is only about 35 cents. With fossil fuels, a kilowatt-hour costs just a few cents.But solar still has much room for improvement. Commercial cells are only 10 to 15 percent efficient. With much more research, new strategies to absorb sunlight more efficiently could lead to cells that reached 50 to 60 percent efficiency. If the cells could be made cheaply enough, they could produce electricity for only 1 or 2 cents a kilowatt-hour.Dr. Arthur Nozik, a senior research fellow at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colo., said the advanced solar concepts were scientifically feasible. But, echoing Dr. Hoffert, Dr. Nozik said: ""We need like a Manhattan Project or an Apollo program to put a lot more resources into solving the problem. It's going to require a revolution, not an evolution. I wouldn't expect to get there in 2050 if we're going at the same pace.""But if scientists succeed with a cheap, efficient solar cell, ""you'd be on Easy Street,"" Dr. Nozik said.Wind power is already practical in many places like Denmark, where 17 percent of the electricity comes from wind turbines. The newest turbines, with propellers as wide in diameter as a football field, produce energy at a cost of 4 or 5 cents a kilowatt-hour. Further refinements like lighter rotors could drop the price by another cent or two, making it directly competitive with natural gas.Dr. Robert W. Thresher, director of the National Wind Technology Center at the energy laboratory, envisions large farms of wind turbines being built offshore. ""They would be out of sight,"" he said. ""There's no shortage of space and wind.""Solar and wind power will be hampered because the sun doesn't always shine and the wind doesn't always blow. The current power grid is not well suited for intermittent power sources because the amount of power produced at any moment must match the amount being consumed. To exploit the sun and wind, utilities would have to develop devices that could act as giant batteries.One concept is to pump compressed air into an underground cavern. When electricity was needed, the air would be released, and the air pressure would turn a turbine to generate electricity.The Big IdeasThen there are the big ideas that could change everything. To get around the problem of the intermittency in solar power, solar arrays could be placed where the sun shines 24 hours a day -- in space. The power could be beamed to the ground via microwaves.Another big idea comes from Dr. Klaus S. Lackner, a professor of geophysics at Columbia University: what if carbon dioxide could be scrubbed out of the air? His back-of-the-envelope calculations indicate it may be feasible, although he is far from being ready to demonstrate how.But if that were possible, that would eliminate the need to shift from gasoline to hydrogen for cars. That would save the time and cost of building pipelines for shipping hydrogen, and gasoline is in many ways a superior fuel than hydrogen. (Hydrogen needs to be stored under very high pressure or at very cold temperatures.) Owners of gas-guzzling S.U.V.'s could assuage their guilt by paying for the scrubbing of carbon dioxide produced by their vehicles.Eventually, the captured carbon dioxide could be processed to create an artificial gasoline, Dr. Lackner said. Then the world would discover, much to its surprise, that everything old would be new and clean again.""Carbon may actually be just as clean, just as renewable,"" Dr. Lackner said."
"4","Article 4","The irony of lunch-bucket-turned-high-tech Pittsburgh hosting a global financial summit scheduled to tackle the daunting challenge of paying for a less carbon intensive energy future is rich on so many levels.Perhaps nowhere in the world have industrial emissions been reduced and the skies cleared so much as in Pittsburgh, where the G-20 finance ministers will gather Thursday and Friday.But know, too, that because carbon dioxide -- unlike some other greenhouse gases -- stays in the atmosphere so long, a component of the climate change problem billowed from Henry Clay Frick's coke ovens and Andrew Carnegie's steel mills.The region's transformative changes during the last 50 years did not come easily or cheaply in either human or financial terms. And the changes that will be required to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change on a global scale over the next 50 years promise to be even greater.Maybe the Pittsburgh setting will provide context for taking the bold action that a scientific consensus says is necessary now. Certainly the region's rich environmental history gives leaders of current greening efforts a unique perspective on what can and should be done to make the massive and expensive transitions needed to address climate change.Here are some thoughts about what they envision as the important next steps needed to address climate change locally, nationally or internationally:Teresa Heinz, chair, Heinz Endowments, Heinz Family Philanthropies, said Pittsburgh is the perfect G-20 host city because the promises and realities of cooperatively embarking on a green, sustainable recovery will be all around them.""One of the best ways we can address the threats of global climate change is to expand the innovation we've seen here across the country, investing in green technology, alternative energy and green chemistry that will create jobs, strengthen our infrastructure and power our nation through domestic sources that can develop right here at home. It's an optimistic reality that proves it's not a choice between the environment or jobs. Quite the contrary, the environment is jobs.""For our efforts to combat climate change to be truly successful, however, we will need to forge binding agreements between regions, states and countries that control harmful emissions and hold each other to account as one region's activities and efforts now directly impact, or undermine, another's.""Pittsburgh, even on its best days, has trouble with air quality compliance, not because of its own doing, but because of what its neighbors are doing. Pittsburgh stands as a powerful example of what we're all capable of and I hope the G-20 leaders can take something valuable home from our experience.""Jared L. Cohon, Carnegie Mellon University president, said Pittsburgh should make research and development of clean coal technologies the highest priority because despite its emissions problems the world will continue to rely on it while alternative energy sources are developed.""If we, as a major center of coal production, want coal to be part of the longterm fuel mix for electricity generation, and if we care about the interim impacts, we must have a sense of urgency about developing ways to capture and store carbon generated from coal. Carnegie Mellon scientists and engineers are working on just these issues in collaboration with colleagues at the University of Pittsburgh, West Virginia University and the National Energy Technology Laboratory.""With this kind of cooperative effort expanded in scope and participants, Pittsburgh and our region can make a very important contribution to reducing coal's impact on climate and the environment.""""For too long, the world has played a game of, 'I'll limit my emissions of carbon dioxide, if you'll limit yours.' It is time to lead by example and get the rest of the world to follow -- either because they get embarrassed or because we won't trade with them again until they do.""Kathleen McGinty, former state Department of Environmental Protection secretary, environmental official in the Clinton administration and advisor with Pittsburgh solar technology firm Plextronics Inc., said tackling climate change will take a mix of old and new technologies plus the old-fashioned work ethic Pittsburgh is known for.""Solving the climate crisis isn't about some wondrous new technology or impossible to imagine inventions. It is about building and installing efficient boilers and ballasts and buildings. It is about bolting solar panels on roofs and hanging them on street lamps and utility poles. It is about steel towers in the ground with wind turbines on top. It is about cars charged with the new ""lead carbon"" super-batteries being made right here at home, right now. And it is about capturing carbon from our coal plants and using it to enrich the soil, even as we stop it from polluting the air.""In other words, winning the battle against climate change is about the very things that the people of Pittsburgh are very good at and where the Pittsburgh area is second to none: Pittsburgh has abundant raw energy resources. Pittsburgh has the basic industries and the skill sets needed in steel and glass and aluminum. Pittsburgh has more green buildings than nearly any city in the country. And the region is now home to some of the most promising solar, wind, biofuel, clean coal, battery and efficient window companies anywhere. When it comes to solving the climate crisis, the people of Pittsburgh have all the right stuff.""Larry Schweiger, president of the National Wildlife Federation, former executive director of the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy and author of a new book, ""Last Chance,"" about the impact of climate changes on life and wildlife on Earth, said the G-20 must provide focus to a world on the edge of catastrophic climate change.""First, I hope they reach a collective commitment on strong reduction targets for carbon dioxide proportional to their emissions. I think that type of commitment will be much easier to get with 20 nations in the room than at Copenhagen where there will be 100 nations.""Second, we need to make available technology to help developing nations adapt to changes in sea level, storms, desertification and displaced populations that climate change will cause, helping them skip over old 20th century technologies in favor of better environmental technologies, including solar. And third we need to help make on the ground adaptations to protect people, including moving them back from oceans and waterways, before there is a crisis situation.""The U.S. needs to do more because it caused much of the problem. We cannot walk away from that responsibility because it will not put us in the right place.""M. Granger Morgan, head of the Department of Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University where he directs the Center for Climate Decision Making, said local research leadership can translate into job and economic benefits if leaders act boldly.""To stop climate change, by mid-century the world must reduce its emissions roughly 80 percent. Doing that's going to take everything we've got: more efficient use of energy, coal plants that capture their carbon dioxide and safely put it a mile underground, more wind and nuclear plants, and plug-electric hybrid vehicles that get their power from the U.S., not the Middle East.""Pittsburgh has a great start on most of these activities. We have many new energy efficient green buildings -- but we need to figure out how to make our older buildings, and the appliances in them, use less energy.""Our National Energy Technology Lab, located in the South Hills, leads the world in research on carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) -- but we need to build some CCS plants here. We have several wind farms just to our east but we need more, and our universities need to come up with affordable ways to add large amounts of variable wind into out power system without causing blackouts.""Westinghouse Electric, in our eastern suburbs, is building safe and modern nuclear power plants all over the world. We need to build some here.""Toyota is supporting research at Carnegie Mellon on hybrid cars, including cars that drive most of the time on electricity. We need to replace more of our gas guzzling clunkers with cars like the Prius. In about a year, Chevrolet will release the Volt, its new plug hybrid. Pittsburgh's Chevy dealers should start planning now to make our region the sales leader in the nation.""There are no ""silver bullets"" -- no single technology or strategy that will solve the problem of climate change. Meeting that challenge will take everything we've got -- and in the process create many new jobs.""If we lead, the rest of the world will follow. If we sit on our hands and wait for others, our grandchildren will not thank us!""Matthew Mehalik, Sustainable Pittsburgh program manager, said climate change is a complex issue that the region's Business Climate Coalition is working on from a sustainable perspective that does not disadvantage local industries.""We want to be on the right side of history when we approach climate change and we have to factor climate issues into our regional planning process. But it's complex. The cost of transitioning away from fossil fuels is great but we can't continue to rely on coal. On the other hand, we need to take advantage of our wealth. I have the feeling that the G-20 may try to reduce a complex situation to good guys and bad guys, but these companies recognize they need to start changing their business model.""There is also a need to keep shining a light on business operations to motivate change.""Joel A. Tarr, the Caliguiri University Professor of History and Policy at Carnegie Mellon University and author of ""Devastation and Renewal,"" an environmental history of Pittsburgh and its region, said leadership and some calculated risk taking is needed and, if history is any guide, change won't come easily.""Pittsburgh has accomplished major environmental improvements in the past half-century but does this history provide any clues to strategies that might be followed in order to achieve future goals? Critical to their accomplishment was political and private leadership willing to take risks, unafraid of challenging powerful vested interests, and allied with citizens groups.""This leadership must be willing to challenge the status quo and to educate the public to their real interests in regard to health and the environment in order to achieve significant environmental goals.""Patricia M. DeMarco, Rachel Carson Homestead Association executive director, said climate change solutions must be found in how we produce energy and also in how we limit its use.""We waste two thirds of the fuel we burn through inefficiencies in the conversion process, and inefficiencies at the point of use. We need to re-think our approach to using energy to perform necessary work. Finding least energy use solutions for space conditioning in buildings, moving people, and goods, communications, and industrial processes has received very little applied research attention.""The most important way Pittsburgh can contribute to climate change remedies is to apply the significant concentration of academic and industrial capability to the problem of reducing the use of fossil fuels through demand improvements. Distributed power based on renewable resources, building designs that require almost no externally supplied energy, community designs around mass transit and pedestrian convenience all can dramatically reduce our fossil fuel use.""The benefits of moving to a post-fossil fuel economy include the potential for large health improvements. One in four Americans suffer from asthma and chronic allergies, one in 150 children are born with autism syndrome. Both have been linked to particulate and chemical contaminant emissions from fossil fuel combustion in vehicles and power plants. We need to count the health cost of fossil fuel extraction and combustion in the avoided cost for converting to renewable and sustainable energy systems.""""Rachel Carson's environmental ethic provides four principles to guide our path to a sustainable future: live in harmony with nature; preserve and learn from natural places; minimize the impact of synthetic chemicals on the natural systems of the world; and consider the implications of human actions on the global web of life.""We have issued a Rachel Carson Legacy Challenge asking people, institutions, governments and businesses to make permanent, measurable changes in their lifestyle consistent with Rachel Carson's principles. We ask everyone to take at least one specific step to move toward a more responsible and less wasteful pattern of resource consumption.""Overcoming the inertia to change is difficult. Once we begin to move together toward a pattern of sustainability and a value system that seeks to use a minimum of resources for all of our needs, each subsequent step becomes easier.John Hanger, DEP secretary and former president and chief executive officer of Citizens for Pennsylvania's Future, said Pennsylvania, which emits about 1 percent of the world's heat-trapping gases, has a big role as the climate change drama plays out.""Though our economy has grown greatly since 1960 and we have added more than 1 million people to our population, our emissions have not increased much at all over the last 50 years. Why? Cars today get about twice as many miles per gallon as those on the road 50 years ago. New appliances and buildings today are much more energy efficient than 50 years ago. About a half of our electricity generation now comes from zero carbon technologies like nuclear, wind, solar, biomass, as well as natural gas that emits less carbon than other fossil fuels when 50 years ago all of our electricity came from burning coal and oil.""To continue this progress, we must use both law and markets. Laws like building codes and vehicle mileage standards must boost energy efficiency as well as low-carbon fuels and electricity; competitive markets must operate to produce efficiently cleaner appliances, electricity, vehicles; and public-private partnerships must develop new and better technologies like carbon capture and storage for coal plants.""Scott Van de Mark, director of special projects for the Pennsylvania Environmental Council, is working with Allegheny County to help reduce its global warming emissions footprint.""From a local and regional standpoint, the most cost-effective and direct way for homeowners, businesses and governments to reduce their carbon footprint is to improve the energy efficiency of our homes, businesses and government buildings. With an older building stock in a colder climate in the Pittsburgh region, there are multiple opportunities to retrofit buildings and reduce energy usage and cost by upgrading insulation, replacing light bulbs or choosing to construct new facilities or renovate existing facilities in accordance with the LEED green building certification program.""The Pennsylvania Environmental Council is honored to be assisting Allegheny County with the development of a greenhouse gas emissions inventory for county-owned and operated facilities and vehicle fleets. The inventory will be followed by a set of recommended actions for the county to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions including several cost-effective actions to improve the efficiency of heating, cooling and lighting county facilities.

"5","Article 5","Richard Branson likes to pretend that business is his hobby; he sees himself as a modern version of a nineteenth-century British adventurer-Phileas T. Fogg, unbound. Rather than travelling around the world in eighty days, however, he appears to be trying to find eighty ways to do it. In 1986, Branson, the founder of the Virgin Group of companies, crossed the Atlantic in the fastest time ever recorded, on his boat the Virgin Atlantic Challenger II. The next year, the Virgin Atlantic Flyer, history's largest hot-air balloon, became the first to travel the same path. Bad weather and technical glitches forced him to abort several attempts at becoming the first to fly a balloon around the world without stopping.But in 1991 Branson soared over the Pacific Ocean from Japan to the Canadian Arctic, again establishing records while travelling at speeds of more than two hundred miles per hour. Branson may well hold another record: the number of highly publicized near-death experiences. He has been pulled from the sea five times by helicopters (and once from a frozen lake). During one of his attempts to circle the globe, Branson crashed into the Algerian desert. During another, in 1998, the Chinese Air Force threatened to shoot his balloon out of the sky as it crossed the Himalayas. It took Britain's best diplomats to keep him aloft and alive. Not long afterward, he crashed into the Pacific. Branson, who has now bet much of his fortune on developing ecologically benign sources of fuel, was asked recently if his swashbuckling persona wasn't simply an advertisement for his airline, Virgin Atlantic. ""The P.R. experts actually have said that as an airline owner the last thing I should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats and crashing into the sea,'' he replied. ""And they have a point. When I went over on the Virgin Atlantic Flyer, our airline took a full-page ad which said something like 'Come on, Richard, there are better ways of crossing the Atlantic.' ""There is luck, and then there is Richard Branson's luck. In 1977, he took an inadvertent spin on a sort of tricycle that had huge wings and an outboard motor-it was called a pterodactyl flying machine. It had been flown only once, but the inventor, a man named Richard Ellis, was seeking investors. He thought immediately of Branson, who saw the machine, jumped on, and started to pedal. Before he knew what was happening, Branson found himself hundreds of feet in the air. He still has no idea how he made it down alive; the next week, Ellis also decided to give it a whirl. He plunged to the ground and died on impact. Branson has even survived a shipwreck. In 1974, he went with his first wife, Kristen Tomassi, to Cozumel, to try and patch up a marriage that had suffered from numerous affairs on both sides. The area has some of the world's best marlin fishing, and one day they and another couple decided to hire a deep-sea boat. Two miles out, a severe storm began to pound the boat; after a frightening hour or so, the wind and rain subsided, but Branson and his wife concluded that they were in the storm's eye. Convinced that the boat could not withstand another attack, they urged the others to try to swim with them to safety. Nobody was willing to join them. ""We stripped off to our underwear and the fisherman gave us a plank of wood from the bottom of the boat,"" Branson recalled. Somehow, despite ten-foot waves, the couple fought their way to shore. Neither the boat nor its occupants were ever seen again.The adventure didn't save the marriage. Tomassi ran off with the singer Kevin Ayers and moved to Hydra. Branson followed them, but he couldn't win her back. Yet, as he noted in his autobiography, ""Losing My Virginity,"" the marriage may well have failed for an even more fundamental reason. ""Kristen and I had a bizarre sexual allergy to each other,'' he wrote. ""Whenever we made love a painful rash spread across me which would take about three weeks to heal. We went to a number of doctors but we never resolved the problem. I even had a circumcision to try to stop the reaction.""Branson leaves the ground as often as possible-on kite boards, parasails, gliders, bungee cords, wind boards, wake boards-and soon, if all goes as planned, he intends to add rocket ships to his repertoire. He also likes to ski, and this winter he took his family to Zermatt. (He and his second wife, Joan, have two children: Holly, a twenty-four-year-old medical student, and Sam, twenty-one, who has recently begun to work with Virgin Media.) On February 23rd, Branson's cell phone rang while they were at dinner. He ignored it. Branson is almost absurdly accessible-he treats his e-mail address like a business card, offering it to anyone who asks (and to many who don't). But, when he goes on a family holiday, he tries to step off the grid. The phone kept ringing, though, and eventually he decided that he had better see who it was. ""With most people, when the phone rings at odd hours their first thought is: Oh, I hope the children are all right,'' Branson told me a few days later. ""But, if you happen to have an airline, well, then, there is another call you also fear.''It was indeed bad news, but not from Virgin Atlantic. The trouble was in a different arm of Branson's transportation empire: a nine-carriage Virgin Pendalino train, en route to Glasgow from London's Euston Station, had derailed on a remote hillside in Cumbria with more than a hundred passengers on board. Initial reports were spotty, but the train, travelling at nearly a hundred miles an hour, had slid down an embankment and flipped onto its side. Branson drove through the night, reaching Zurich at 6 A.M., just in time to catch the first flight to Manchester. From the airport, he went directly to see passengers and crew members in the hospital. A number of people were seriously injured. He also met with the relatives of the only fatality, an eighty-four-year-old woman. When Branson arrived at the scene of the wreckage, he was astonished by its magnitude. ""It was as if somebody had picked up some Dinky Toys and dropped them all over the English countryside,'' he told me. ""It was shocking that anyone at all came out alive. We have transported sixty million people in one form or another since we started Virgin Atlantic. Our airlines have a one-hundred-per-cent safety record. The train company had as well. I'm the sort of person who cries at a happy film,'' he said, swallowing hard. ""I cry at a sad film. . . . Of course, I knew this kind of day would come. I have prepared myself for it. But you can't know in advance of a tragedy how you are going to act. You just can't know.''Reporters were surprised to see Branson at the crash site before the cause had been determined. ""It was really the bare minimum one can do in a situation like that,'' he said. ""If my children or family had been in that crash, I would have expected the owner of the train to get there as quickly as possible, find out what was going on, and see how he could help.'' It soon became clear that track-maintenance workers had failed to secure several bolts at a crucial junction, and National Rail officials acknowledged that they-and not Virgin-were to blame. Police surveying the destruction said that only a ""miracle"" had prevented greater loss of life. The reason was actually more prosaic: Branson's trains were built with safety specifications drawn from Virgin's experience in the aircraft industry. There were no sharp edges on seats or tables. Not a single window broke, and the coaches remained linked, despite the force of the crash. ""The one positive thing that came out of it is that the money we spent on building those trains was well worth it,"" Branson told me.That night, Branson led every newscast, which wasn't surprising. His talent for public relations is as well documented as his fetish for personal and financial risk. Together, they have made him one of the richest men in England. Still, rarely has a fatal accident proved so beneficial to any company: Branson called the driver a hero for staying at his post; he also invited the press to tour the factory to see how the manufacturer built safety into each carriage. Virgin e-mailed every customer, explaining what had happened and how the accident would affect schedules, and expressing condolences to the family of the woman who died. ""I don't know what other C.E.O. you would have seen rushing to a crash that way,"" Bernd Schmitt told me. Schmitt is the executive director of the Center on Global Brand Leadership, at Columbia Business School. ""He couldn't have planned a better response; other guys would have buried their heads in a spreadsheet. But that is one of the reasons the Virgin brand works as well as it does: Branson doesn't plan these things at all. He just does them.""Virgin ranks among the largest privately owned corporations in Europe. The group has fifty-five thousand employees working in more than two hundred loosely federated companies, which include not just Megastores and airlines-in addition to Virgin Atlantic, there are Virgin Nigeria and the Australian carrier Virgin Blue, as well as a private airline and a helicopter service-but also Virgin Limousines and Limobikes, Virgin Money, Virgin Active (health clubs), and Virgin Games (gambling). There are Virgin companies that sell cosmetics, condoms, comics, picnics, and wine. There is one that owns spas and game preserves, another that arranges balloon trips, and even one called Virgin Brides. In February, Branson, concerned about the future availability of stem cells for children who may one day need them, started Virgin Health Bank, which will store cord blood for use later in life. I once asked Branson to describe how he decides to start a business. ""It's just basically what interests me,"" he said. ""When I was younger, we had Virgin Night Clubs. Now we have Virgin Health Clubs."" He shrugged. ""I guess Virgin Funerals are inevitable.""One of Branson's newest companies, Virgin Galactic, plans to become the first to offer regularly scheduled trips into the cosmos. Five vessels are under construction, and Virgin has already collected full fares-roughly two hundred thousand dollars each-from more than a hundred and seventy-five passengers. (One man cashed in two million Virgin Atlantic frequent-flier miles for his seat.) The initial trips, in 2009, will last two and a half hours and take customers sixty-eight miles into space. Eventually, though, Branson envisages rocket travel across the globe-thirty-minute flights, for instance, between New York and Sydney-as well as to space hotels and to the moon. He also has his hands full on earth. His newest conglomerate, Virgin Media, is in a highly public struggle with Rupert Murdoch's Sky Broadcasting Group for control of Britain's digital and cable riches. On February 8th, Branson turned up at Covent Garden, slung the high-end stripper Dita Von Teese over his shoulder, and spirited her off to a hansom cab pulled by two black horses. They arrived at a glass-enclosed living room that had been placed next to the Royal Opera House. There Branson spent the rest of the day promoting the new company by watching only Virgin Media cable programs and communicating with the ""outside world"" solely through Virgin's mobile phones and Internet connections.He had come to London for another reason as well. Until about a year ago, Branson thought it unlikely that global warming posed consequential problems for the planet. Then Al Gore paid him a visit and Branson quickly succumbed to his slide show. Branson doesn't dabble. If he is in, he is in all the way. Last September, at Bill Clinton's annual Global Initiative meeting in New York, Branson announced that for the next ten years he will divert all profits from his transportation businesses-mostly airplanes-to develop renewable alternatives to carbon fuels. The pledge should amount to three billion dollars-though Branson (who is worth twice that) says that he will make good on the promise even if profits falter. It is by far the biggest such commitment that has yet been made to fight global warming. In February, with Gore at his side, Branson went further, announcing the Virgin Earth Challenge, the largest philanthropic prize ever offered: twenty-five million dollars to anyone who helps impede climate change without seriously disrupting our way of life. The prize-winner will have to find a way to scrub billions of tons of carbon dioxide from the earth's atmosphere. Many people doubt that it can be done, however, and the announcement elicited dreary predictions about the future of the planet. Branson, ever the optimistic entrepreneur, likened the prize to cash inducements that have led to some of history's most notable achievements in navigation, exploration, and industry. ""I believe in our resourcefulness and in our capacity to invent solutions to the problems we have ourselves created,"" he told me. ""We are facing a crisis, but I reject the idea that we have already passed the point of no return.''That afternoon, I met Branson for lunch at the Roof Gardens, in Kensington (another Virgin property). He had hardly slept, and was struggling to make it through the day. At fifty-six, in slightly frayed jeans and an untucked shirt, with a straggly goatee and shaggy blond hair unkempt to perfection, Richard Branson looks like the richest stuntman on earth; but that kind of fun apparently has its limits, and lately he has been talking as if he may have reached them. ""The ballooning and boating helped put Virgin on the map on a global basis,'' he told me. ""I certainly regret none of it. But there are quite a lot of important things going on right now on this planet and I don't really want to kill myself in a stupid way. It didn't seem to matter as much when I was young. I had everything to lose and I wasn't reticent to lose it. But if the question is how would I wish to be remembered, I guess I would have to say not as somebody who spent his life in a balloon.""Richard Branson has always lived by Wilde's adage that ""there is only one thing worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.'' In his case, there is nothing to fear. In 2002, the British Broadcasting Corporation asked its viewers to select history's hundred greatest Britons. He ranked eighty-fifth, comfortably ahead of Sir Walter Raleigh and King Henry II. He even got more votes than Bono, though not as many as Jane Austen or Lawrence of Arabia. The following year, Channel 4 held its own poll, for the hundred ""Britons we love to hate."" This time, the audience was told to choose only among the living; Branson-along with Tony Blair, Queen Elizabeth II, and David Beckham-was one of the few to make both lists. ""My hat is off to Sir Richard Branson,'' one woman wrote to a local newspaper after the train crash. ""I wish that man was running the country.'' It is a surprisingly common sentiment, and has been for years, but so is this: ""Are you kidding me?"" one man replied when the letter went up on the newspaper's Web site. ""He comes across to me as a publicity-seeking sleaze.""What other knight of the realm would appear, waterskiing, on ""Baywatch,"" or as a guest star on ""Friends""? (He and his son, Sam, also turned up as harried passengers in ""Casino Royale,"" cameos they earned by lending the producers a jet. Fittingly, Branson had a small role in the 2004 remake of ""Around the World in Eighty Days."") In person, Branson is notably soft-spoken and deferential. In fact, the best way to describe him is shy. Utter the word ""Virgin,"" however, and there doesn't really seem to be anything he won't do. Branson shakes every hand that appears in front of his face, and I once saw him pose for the same picture with a mortified teen-ager four times because the boy's mother couldn't figure out how to work her cell phone. (""I just want to tell you that in Saline County, Kansas, we adore you,'' she said. ""Have you heard of Saline County?"" Branson shrugged and said, ""Isn't that where the Yellow Brick Road ends up?"") Not long ago, Branson invited the MTV show ""Cribs"" for a tour of Necker Island, his private hideaway in the British Virgin Islands. His American television series on Fox, ""The Rebel Billionaire: Branson's Quest for the Best,"" barely limped through a season-the opening credits played over the theme ""Live and Let Die"" (""The name is Branson,'' he says, while the camera flashes to the wing of one of his planes. ""Sir Richard Branson."") Naturally, the program was compared to ""The Apprentice,"" whose star, Donald Trump, couldn't resist gloating when it failed. ""Richard Branson, your ratings speak very loudly, and you just got fired!'' he said, before going on to trash Branson personally. ""I don't believe he's a billionaire,'' Trump, who has often been accused of exaggerating his own fortune, said. ""I wish him a lot of luck in the businesses. But, I can tell you, on television he's a total failure."" In some respects, Branson is the anti-Trump. There are no monumental Branson Towers in London; in fact, his name appears on no building at all. At Virgin, Branson's nickname is Dr. Yes, largely because he has never been able to bring himself to fire people, and often has trouble saying no to even the most ridiculous and unsolicited ideas.Branson simply doesn't possess the shame gene that governs so much of upper-class British life. He was knighted in 1999, and three years later, as a guest at Queen Elizabeth's Golden Jubilee, he found himself laughing quietly at the irony of his metamorphosis-first hippie entrepreneur, then Thatcher-era yuppie, and, finally, socially conscious leader of Cool Britannia-because he doesn't think he's changed a bit. ""I remember being with the Sex Pistols riding down the Thames on a boat in 1977,'' he said. ""And they were singing, 'God save the Queen, her fascist regime,' and everybody getting arrested. Then, twenty-five years later, there I am sitting next to the Queen at Buckingham Palace, having been knighted. And I couldn't help thinking, I wonder if she can remember what I was doing on the day of her Silver Jubilee.""The Queen may have warmed to Branson, but much of the rest of the Wellington-boot crowd has not. They consider him ""common"" and-even more horrific-eager to earn money. Yet Branson's popularity is such that when Apple Computer ran its ""Think Different"" ads in England his photograph appeared along with those of Einstein and Gandhi as one of the people who shaped the twentieth century. As a man who is both rapaciously capitalistic and intemperately candid, he seems to belong more in Oprah's world than in Churchill's. ""There are some things about the British that obviously have never appealed to me,'' he said. ""I was watching tennis the other day and looking at all those guys in their blazers in the Royal Box. It just made me shiver. I feel more comfortable amongst Americans oftentimes. Britain is changing, but there is still a fairly fuddy-duddy establishment.""Branson was raised in Surrey and educated as a proper, upper-middle-class British boy; he attended Stowe, among whose other graduates-they are called Old Stoics-have been David Niven, Prince Rainier, and Christopher Robin Milne. From an early age, he and his two sisters were taught that the alternative to standing on their own feet would be disaster. ""My mother was determined to make us independent,'' he has written. ""When I was four she stopped the car a few miles from our house and made me find my own way home across the fields. My youngest sister Vanessa's earliest memory is being woken up in the dark one January morning because Mum had decided that I should cycle to Bournemouth that day.'' Branson was eleven and Bournemouth was a fifty-mile ride. ""She did things then that if she did them now she would be arrested,'' Branson told me recently. I asked him if he thought his flamboyance and love of the spotlight were in any way attempts to hold his parents' attention. ""I don't think in psychiatric terms,'' he replied quickly, ending the discussion. He has always been close to his parents and intends, in two years, when his father turns ninety, to accompany him into space.Branson had no interest in school and was a famously bad student. ""Richard is highly intelligent but educationally dyslexic,'' his longtime lieutenant Will Whitehorn told me. ""It has freed him to live by his gut reaction to things, and that has served him well. I was brought up in a more academic environment-to find there was always a reason why something can't happen. Richard hates it when people tell him that. He isn't hamstrung by academic disputes. He finds them tedious."" Branson is like a musician who cannot read music but has perfect pitch. He never finished school or attended university; when he left Stowe, his headmaster told him, ""You are either going to be a millionaire or going to jail."" Branson did both. He opened a health center in the crypt of a church in central London in 1968. Soon he was prosecuted under the 1917 Venereal Diseases Act, which was intended to prevent charlatans from working as doctors. The center dispensed advice and not medicine, however, so the charges were dropped.His next indictment, under the 1889 Indecent Advertisements Act, was in 1977, when the Sex Pistols released their only album, ""Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols,"" on the Virgin Records label. "" 'Bollocks' was considered an unforgivably rude word,'' Branson said. The playwright and lawyer John Mortimer successfully defended him by producing an expert witness to demonstrate that the word ""bollocks"" was derived from an Anglo-Saxon term and could be used to refer to a priest. The witness even turned up in court wearing clerical garb. The judge, to his dismay, was forced to dismiss the charges, saying, ""Much as my colleagues and I wholeheartedly deplore the vulgar exploitation of the worst instincts of human nature for the purchases of commercial profits by both you and your company, we must reluctantly find you not guilty.''Branson made his defining fortune through Virgin Records, which he founded as a mail-order retailer in 1970 to raise money for a magazine called Student, which he was running. A postal strike threatened to destroy the mail-order business, so he opened a record shop on Oxford Street. It didn't take him long to see that it would make more sense to record music than to buy it, so he built a studio and signed the first Virgin artist, Mike Oldfield. It was a classic piece of Branson luck: the opening song on Oldfield's album, ""Tubular Bells,'' became the theme to ""The Exorcist""-which helped it sell five million copies. For a long time, Oldfield earned Virgin more money than all its other acts combined. Relying too heavily on one artist is not much of a business plan, though; the Sex Pistols had been dumped by two labels, and nobody else was willing to sign them. They were repulsive and seemed to spend as much time shooting up and throwing up as they did playing music. But their outrages made news and, oddly, they brought Branson credibility that allowed him to sign people like Steve Winwood, Boy George, and Peter Gabriel.Branson likes to enter a market controlled by a giant-British Airways, say, or Coke, or Murdoch. Then he presents himself as the hip alternative. (Usually it works, but not always. Virgin Cola, which was launched in 1994, was a disaster, though ""we are still No. 1 in Bangladesh,"" Branson told me recently.) Virgin Atlantic Airways got its start, in part, because Branson was pissed off that a flight he was planning to take to Puerto Rico had been cancelled. After finding a company that would charter a jet for two thousand dollars, he divided the price by the number of seats, borrowed a blackboard, and wrote, ""Virgin Airways, $39 single flight to Puerto Rico."" As he recalls it, ""I walked around the terminal and soon filled every seat on the plane.""Virgin started flying in 1984, on one route with one leased jetliner. ""At that time, the airline industry was even worse than it is now,'' he told me. ""You were lucky if you got a piece of warmed-over chicken dumped on your lap. People were treated like cattle; it wasn't necessary or good business.'' Virgin became the first airline to equip every coach seat with video displays and the first to offer in-flight massage and manicure services. Good service gets you only so far, though. The airline business is brutal-Branson likes to say that the easiest way to become a millionaire is to start as a billionaire and buy an airline. Nonetheless, he is about to start a new one in the U.S.-Virgin America, which will at first serve San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York. ""When we began, more than twenty years ago, we were competing with thirteen airlines across the Atlantic,'' he said. ""Of those thirteen, twelve have gone into bankruptcy or Chapter 11. There is only British Airways and ourselves flying who have not. A lot of those carriers were enormous: Air Florida, Pan Am. But it shows in the end that most people seek out quality over a really ghastly service, which is what most American airlines provide.""British Airways didn't take kindly to its new competitor. In 1990, after Branson completed a highly publicized mercy mission to Iraq to bring home hostages of Saddam Hussein, B.A.'s chairman, Lord King, told his top aides to ""do something"" about Virgin and its chief executive. That edict began an extensive secret war against Branson and Virgin which came to be known as the ""dirty tricks"" campaign. British Airways lied to Virgin's customers, tampered with its databases, and spread false rumors about Branson himself. Branson sued, and in 1993 B.A., facing certain defeat in court, conceded that it had taken those actions and apologized publicly. Branson received a libel judgment of six hundred and ten thousand pounds, which he distributed among his staff; it became known as the B.A. bonus. The airline was also assessed court fees that ran into the millions; King was forced to retire early, and in disgrace. The incident cemented Virgin's reputation as the little guy always willing to take on Goliaths; it's an image that persists, despite the fact that Virgin stopped being the little guy long ago. (Nor has the bad blood subsided; two weeks ago, when British Airways began showing ""Casino Royale"" on its flights, the airline removed Branson from his scene, and obscured the fin of a Virgin jet.) ""It's a hell of a lot more fun being in the David role,"" Branson said. The victory came at a cost, though. Many of Branson's other businesses were in financial peril during the nineteen-eighties. Fighting British Airways cost a fortune, so in 1992 Branson sold Virgin Music's record label, publishing arm, and recording studios to Thorn EMI, for a billion dollars.""It was a very difficult decision,'' Branson told me. ""I had just signed the Rolling Stones, and I had spent a lot of my life trying to do that. Virgin had become the biggest independent record company in the world. It was exploding on all fronts, and these were people who I had been working with since I was a teen-ager. . . . So it was certainly not something I wanted to do.""I never have regrets,'' he continued. ""They just don't seem to solve anything. But it is true that when I got this billion-dollar check it wasn't an easy day for me. I had just talked to the staff and explained what was happening and I was running down the street with tears streaming down my face. Then I passed a newspaper kiosk and I saw all the headlines: 'BRANSON SELLS FOR A BILLION.' I remember thinking, Well, this will make an incredibly strange picture if anyone should catch it.""Necker Island sits atop seventy-four acres of rock in the dazzling blue center of the British Virgin Islands. It is surrounded by coral reefs, equipped with every type of water board, kite, and sailboat known to man, and staffed by a professional tennis coach, a chef, a full-time masseuse (who previously had worked for Virgin Atlantic in its Upper Class cabin), yoga instructors, and several dozen other staff members. From the edge of the infinity pool at the Great House, one can gaze across thickets of roses, iris, and rhododendron, into the azure sea and out toward Virgin Gorda. Flamingos strut around the pond. Branson bought Necker in 1972, for a hundred and thirty thousand pounds, when it had nothing on it but a couple of palm trees; over the years, he has transformed the island into the kind of place that any man with a few billion dollars and an acute understanding of pleasure would appreciate. He recently bought its nearest neighbor, Moskito Island, for ten million dollars, and plans, with a combination of windmills, solar energy, and tidal power, to make both islands independent of fuel that burns carbon.These days, Branson is on Necker more than anywhere else; but when he is not it becomes a resort, available to groups willing to pay forty-six thousand dollars a day. (Spa treatments are not included.) The island is a favorite of celebrities-the long list includes Steven Spielberg, Bill Gates, Kate Moss, and, most famously, Princess Diana-because it affords at least some privacy. (When Diana was there with her sons, the paparazzi assault on the beaches-by land, sea, and air-was so vigorous and intrusive that Branson worked out a deal: one day, the Princess presented herself briefly for a few thousand pictures; then the photographers had to disappear.)The morning I arrived (by boat, though most guests use the heliport), Branson's wife, Joan, was eating breakfast in the great room with several of her friends. She and Branson have been married for more than seventeen years, and have been companions for thirty. They met in 1976, when her then husband was recording an album in the Virgin Studios. ""I make up my mind about someone within thirty seconds of meeting that person,"" Branson wrote later, ""and thus I fell for Joan from the moment I saw her."" A reserved but pleasant woman-""sensible, pragmatic Glaswegian"" is the phrase Branson almost always uses to describe her-she serves as his principal source of gravity. Once, at a Microsoft conference, Bill Gates asked the crowd if there was even one person left who never used the Internet. Joan had to grab Branson's hand to keep him from raising it. It was Joan who suggested the Virgin Earth Prize.The great room is lit with ecologically friendly light bulbs that hang from a series of huge, intricately patterned ostrich eggs. The Bransons' children, Holly and Sam, are often with them on the island, and when they are apart Branson speaks to them nearly every day. Branson, who rises early, had just finished a Pilates lesson. ""In the last few weeks, I have discovered something that I have always laughed at my friends for doing,'' he volunteered sheepishly. ""Yoga and Pilates. I feel great from it, and if I want to continue to be active when I am ninety I am going to need to rely on both of them."" Pilates was the first event of a day that included water sports and a tennis match, and which eventually resembled a mini-Olympics. ""Fancy a sail?"" he asked after breakfast. It was more of a command than a question, and we were soon racing toward Beef Island in a Hobie Cat, its pontoons slapping the water fiercely as we tried to keep up with two boats carrying friends of his. They quickly moved far ahead of us. Branson looked irritated and then assumed his more common ""Hey, it's only rock and roll"" expression: ""If you are first, it's a race,'' he explained, as we tried desperately to come about and catch the wind. ""If not, it's just sailing."" We were forced to abandon our plan to circle a nearby island, because it was getting close to mealtime and Branson wasn't about to miss his traditional British Sunday lunch: roast beef, turnips, greens, and several types of potatoes.Since his first encounter with Gore, Branson has become obsessed with developing alternative sources of energy. His new venture, Virgin Fuels, is not so much a company as a fund that seeks to invest in projects that will produce environmentally benign fuel. Branson has a pattern with his businesses: he is intensely involved at the beginning, and then, as a leadership team finds its stride, he loosens the reins. This time, though, he shows no sign of inching away. ""There are days when we speak three times,'' Shai Weiss, the company's C.E.O., told me. ""Richard definitely believes in delegating, but this is not just another business for him."" Virgin Fuels has committed more than four hundred million dollars, for research into the feasibility of using enzymes and genetically modified organisms to produce clean fuels. Branson's initial focus, however, has been on ethanol and butanol. ""These technologies are further along than some others, so it makes sense to me to invest in them,"" he said. ""You might as well tick the winning boxes first.""Branson is agnostic about which fuels to support, as long as they are commercially and ecologically viable. Today, of course, his companies-and his fortune-are largely propelled by oil, a finite resource whose availability can only diminish. Government regulations-even in the United States-are also making oil increasingly costly. Biodegradable products like corn and sugar, on the other hand, are renewable sources of energy, and you don't have to get them from Iraq, Russia, or Saudi Arabia. When biofuels are manufactured in sufficient quantities, they should be far cheaper than oil, and Virgin Fuels will benefit directly from any technologies it develops, which means that the company could earn large profits from its investment. ""Isn't it surprising to you that there are no biofuels billionaires?"" Branson asked, making it clear that he intends to become the first. ""If there has ever been a market that needs new products, this is it.""""Let us just assume that somebody does win this prize,"" he continued. ""That could result in us not all having to radically change our lives. Personally, I think there are a lot of aspects of our basic lives that are pretty shitty anyway. Sitting alone in a car with dirty fuel spilling all around you. There must be a better way. The economic sacrifices we are going to have to make to stop global warming are massive, and we must hedge on that. If somebody wins this prize, there is just the possibility that at that stage, and at that stage only""-he paused for a moment-""well, this is a dangerous thing to say, because I don't want anyone to think we don't have to change. But there is enormous economic benefit to the world if we could find a technological solution.""The mere concept of mixing philanthropy with profit infuriates many environmental activists. Branson's motives have been questioned almost as often as his generosity has been praised. ""And then Richard Branson came along with his 'Environmental Windfall' of $3 billion and his promise to clean up global transport,"" Keith Farnish wrote on his Earth Blog not long ago. Farnish described it as a ""wonderfully spun P.R. stunt"" that will have almost no effect on the emission of greenhouse gases. Tony Juniper, of Friends of the Earth, said, ""Richard Branson is not embarking on a program of philanthropy here and giving away money to good causes. What he is doing is reinvesting money from his business into a different kind of business for the future."" In fact, few serious scientists believe that climate change can be addressed in any meaningful way simply by seeking technological solutions; fundamental changes in human behavior will be necessary.Branson acknowledges the criticisms, but he doesn't accept a paradigm that holds profit and technology to be incompatible with a cleaner world. ""Even if we never burned another gallon of gasoline, the earth would continue to warm for decades,"" he pointed out. ""So doesn't that suggest that we ought to at least try to find a way to remove some of the carbon we have already produced?"" Ultimately, he believes as a first principle that if a project isn't commercial it isn't going to work. ""As for why I am giving my money away in this manner, obviously it would have made more sense to make investments in lots of sectors, and not just one,"" he said. ""But we all do things for different reasons. Sometimes it's a mixture of what one would consider to be selfless and selfish. A lot of this comes down to how you are brought up. If you are in a position to help, I think you should do so. And I happen to think using our skills in business is the best way for us to be effective. That is what we try to do with Virgin Unite""-Virgin's charity, which focusses on entrepreneurial solutions to problems that range from AIDS in Africa to homelessness in the United States. ""I don't want to get dramatic and say, 'Now I have found my calling,' "" Branson told me. ""But I have to pinch myself if I think back to the height of the Sex Pistols and here I am talking about cellulosic butanol. I never thought my life would go in this direction.""Branson had his first significant encounter with climate change when he read a book called ""The Skeptical Environmentalist,"" by Bjorn Lomborg, a Danish academic who has long challenged the widely held belief that human activity places an unbearable burden on the environment. ""What he argues is that we are headed toward another ice age, and all global warming is doing is slowing up that process,"" Branson said. ""It made sense to me, but it might have also simply made comfortable reading because I am in the airline business.''Converts tend to be the most fervent zealots, however, and Branson has been converted completely. ""If this is the problem that a lot of us think it is, then it is far worse than the First World War and the Second World War combined,"" he said. ""Worse than any war we have ever faced. And you would have thought that world leaders would be meeting with an enormous sense of urgency. And they are not. Yet, even if we are all wrong, you would still have thought that somebody out there would be trying to develop alternatives to our reliance on the Middle East.''On his own property, Branson is deploying multiple sources-wind power, solar energy, and biodiesel-in an attempt to eliminate carbon emissions. Both islands will be more heavily dependent on wind and solar power during the winter. Excess energy will be used to produce and store desalinated water. Branson currently spends nearly four hundred thousand dollars a year on fuel for Necker alone-much of the cost includes the expense of importing diesel. He expects his investment to pay for itself in less than six years. He also hopes to persuade the rest of the British Virgin Islands to follow his lead. ""This is a demonstration project,'' he said. He was wearing a T-shirt inside out and cutoff shorts, and was drinking an iced tea. We were staring out toward the heliport, which will soon have a wind turbine next to it-one of six that he plans to place on the island. ""We want to show that becoming carbon-neutral won't cost money, that it will actually make economic sense. That is the only way you will get most people to change their habits.""This is really not just about us,'' he added. ""The Caribbean needs to get out in front here. If the Arctic goes in the next decade, which is likely, that means Greenland could melt-at least, the ice on top of it. With that we could see a gigantic rise in sea levels. So it is in the self-interest of all islands on the earth to set an example, because they will be among the first affected.''Despite the Bush Administration's tepid response to the threat posed by global warming, cities and states have introduced dozens of measures aimed at producing (and requiring) more energy-efficient vehicles, buildings, and appliances. Studies have shown that even seemingly small conservation efforts can have a dramatic impact on the environment. Australia, for example, may soon require the use of compact fluorescent light bulbs, which expend seventy-five per cent less energy than incandescent bulbs. That shift alone is expected to reduce the country's carbon emissions by four million tons every year. (There are forty-five light bulbs in the average American home; reducing that number by just one would be equivalent to removing nearly a million automobiles from the road.)Conservation can take us only so far, however. Each year, the world's demand for coal, oil, and gas to power factories, cars, and homes increases-and no plan to reduce emissions is likely to succeed unless it includes a major commitment to developing clean, renewable sources of energy. Despite recent increases in the production of ethanol and in the purchase of hybrids, the fundamental relationship between oil and prosperity remains unbroken. And so does a system of subsidies that discourages investments in alternatives. ""I can't think of an example in human history of a bad technology having been replaced by another product whose only improvement was a social good,"" Daniel Kammen told me when we met recently in his office at the University of California at Berkeley, where he founded the Energy and Resources Group at the Goldman School of Public Policy. Branson has hired Kammen and Daniel Prull, one of his graduate students, to devise a scheme to eliminate carbon emissions on Necker. New technologies arise out of ingenuity, sophistication, and need, Kammen argues, not necessarily because they are good for the planet. ""Look at iPods,"" he said. ""They play music. But they do it in a useful, remarkably portable, digital way that serves many purposes-which is why they have spread through our world like a virus. We need to do that with alternative fuels; but, when you look at what most people are advocating, the changes-more use of wind power, and solar energy, for example-are simply not radical enough to create this contagion effect.""The airline industry provides a particularly graphic illustration of the limits of incremental change. Aircraft are responsible for just two per cent of the world's daily burden of greenhouse emissions, but that figure belies their true impact. Eighty-five thousand commercial aircraft take off and land each day, a number that is growing by five per cent a year. At that pace, by 2050 there will be twice as many flights as there are now. That increase is largely a reflection of global prosperity and of the opportunity that comes with it. But the environmental costs are acute: a single flight across the Atlantic can generate more carbon dioxide than an average motorist would produce in a year of driving. Furthermore, that carbon is released exactly where some scientists believe it does the most harm, because each molecule of CO2 created by burning gas or coal takes half of its hundred-year lifetime to rise from a smokestack or an exhaust pipe into the stratosphere.Carbon dioxide released at thirty thousand feet has many effects, and none are salutary. Greenhouse gases slow the process known as the thermohaline cycle, which governs the density of salt in oceans and helps determine the temperature of the polar regions. Too much carbon warms the cycle, and that, in turn, melts sea ice, dramatically affecting fish populations and coral reefs. ""This is a problem we have no plan in place to solve,"" Branson told me. ""I have tried to experiment with slowing down flights and having them fly at lower altitudes."" The benefits of these measures are not large, and it's hard for just one airline to alter the air-traffic system. Earlier this year, Virgin began using tugs to move planes onto runways at some airports, rather than the aircraft's engines. That change alone, on a flight between Heathrow and J.F.K., eliminates the need for two tons of fuel. Two weeks ago, Branson announced that next year, on a Boeing 747, Virgin would make the first commercial flight powered by clean-fuel technology.Daniel Kammen's office is home to the pragmatic, hardheaded faction of the green movement. He is not romantic about saving the earth, and neither are many of his colleagues at Berkeley, who are only too aware that people need incentives to change their behavior. The Berkeley team helped write the legislation that has made California the most environmentally aggressive state with regard to cutting carbon emissions.""It is hard to stress fully enough Richard's importance right now,'' Kammen told me. ""What is still lacking here is what I call the 'third wave' of environmentalism. The first wave was Rachel Carson: recognizing the problem, and understanding that we need to protect the environment. That led to Stage 2: the system of regulations and taxes that helped make it possible to implement the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and other vital legislation.'' They all worked very well, and the environment improved immensely. But regulation has its limits. ""Kyoto is not going to save us,'' Kammen said. ""No global treaty is going to be sufficient. We also need a couple of big actors."" Political decisions like implementing carbon taxes, lowering speed limits, and raising mileage requirements for motor vehicles will all be essential. ""What we need more, though, is a charismatic megaphone,"" Kammen said.""Richard is willing to say, 'This affects my airlines, my trains, and my income,' '' he continued. ""And he knows how to get people to pay attention to him. Of course, the environmental movement contains some of the last true puritans, and those people call him selfish, because he will clearly earn money if this works. But, for God's sake, so what? The man is willing to pull the trigger. I know other people who are just as affluent and they are totally constipated about what to do. Richard is not. He will move from one interesting risky proposition to another. Some will fail-just as some of his businesses have failed. But he keeps moving forward.""At present, Kammen explained, the national power grid flows in one direction, from big central utilities to the consumer. That prevents people with solar panels, say, or windmills from selling excess energy back into the system. ""The model we want for the energy market is more like eBay,"" Kammen told me. ""Sell what you don't use to somebody who wants it. If I can sell power to my utility by demonstrating that I regularly put power into the grid at 4 P.M. on a hot summer day-when demand goes up and it costs the most-that is worth knowing. We could have a rating system, just as they do on eBay, that would let people judge us with confidence as we sell our excess. Renewable sources of energy would go from being the last thing a utility wants to take on board to being the first, because it would cost the utility next to nothing."" If California and other states adopted policies that strongly support plug-in hybrid automobiles, there would be much more demand for clean electricity at night (so people could charge their cars at times when energy was less expensive to use). That would provide a huge incentive for people to install wind farms on their real farms.Ethanol is usually made from corn blended with gasoline, and it accounts for more than ninety-five per cent of the biofuels under development in the United States (which is less than five per cent of the total energy produced). To harvest and refine the corn requires considerable energy (which itself burns fossil fuels). The savings are marginal. There are other ways to make ethanol, though; one of the most promising-cellulosic ethanol-comes from woody plants and grasses. Cellulosic sources can be fermented into ethanol by simply using energy generated by the rest of the plant. This process adds only small amounts of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, because the plants' emissions are balanced by the carbon dioxide that is absorbed as they grow. Substituting cellulosic ethanol for gasoline should reduce greenhouse emissions by as much as ninety per cent.Ethanol is heavy, though, and its density could make it difficult to use in airplanes. Butanol might work, but it is not well enough understood to be used in jet fuel anytime soon. There are more experimental and, perhaps, more promising approaches: scientists are seeking to use the tools of molecular biology, as they have with crops, to produce genetically modified fuel. ""I am so excited about the possibilities of really engineering something that will make a dramatic difference,'' Branson told me when we were on Necker Island. ""It is the biggest type of gamble, perhaps. But that is exactly what we need the most.""Branson mentioned his interest in the work of Amyris Biotechnologies, which got its start in the laboratories of Berkeley and has been concentrating on three synthetic molecules: one to replace gasoline, one that works like diesel, and another to make jet fuel.Synthetic biology-a new field that combines biology, genetics, and engineering-seeks to create and alter organisms so that they can then produce drugs and make other compounds that would help us to move away from our dependence on petroleum products. Amyris has already used such tools to address one of the world's most pressing problems; its first product is a package of genes from three different organisms that, when inserted into yeast, help make artemisinin, the world's only truly effective malaria treatment. Currently, the drug has to be extracted from the sweet-wormwood plant, which is indigenous to China and Vietnam. It is difficult to manufacture in sufficient quantities, particularly at a cost low enough to serve the hundreds of millions of people who need it each year.I drove across the Bay Bridge one morning to speak with John G. Melo, Amyris's C.E.O., at his office in Emeryville. Melo told me that the company's synthetic version of ethanol is based on sugar. Using sugarcane is cheaper and more environmentally benign than using corn, and would place almost no carbon in the atmosphere. ""Initially, we had not thought about jet fuel,"" Melo said. That changed after Branson made his announcement at the Clinton meeting last fall. Jet fuel must function at thirty degrees below zero centigrade, and so far the company's product has been tested only in the laboratory; but Melo said that the Amyris molecule easily passed that test and has essentially the same energy content as the gas that planes use today.""What amazes me the most about all this,"" Branson had told me, ""is how promising the research is and how little money has been invested to help it along. If biofuels are made right, they should help create another green revolution.'' It would be hard to dispute the promise of biofuels-particularly as a replacement for burning oil and coal. Yet almost any project that is derived from collecting trees, crops, or fibre will require an enormous manipulation of nature (as would, surely, most plans to scrub billions of tons of carbon from the atmosphere). The world's forests are already in peril; harvesting trees to make cellulosic ethanol can only make them disappear faster. Few achievements of modern science have been more bitterly disputed than altering the genetic composition of crops for food; to do it for fuel will be no less controversial. The price of corn, sugar, and soybeans is certain to rise if they become powerful sources of energy. Worse yet, each of those crops demands a constant infusion of freshwater-which may be the scarcest commodity of all. Branson is right: if these issues are addressed properly, there could be a new green revolution. But magic bullets are hard to find.I asked Branson whether he might be viewing the world through an unusually optimistic lens. ""I don't know any other way to look at it,'' he replied. ""We know when there is a world war humans are magnificent at changing their behavior. Before Pearl Harbor, six thousand warplanes were made in the United States. Then America went to war, and within three years the number grew to more than a quarter of a million.'' Branson became more animated as he went on. ""In a crisis situation, humans are brilliant. They know how to react. Our problem is that we have not gotten governments into that crisis mode. But if necessary we will do it without them.""There is no gathering of technology geeks more exclusive than TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design), which is held each spring in Monterey. It is an invitation-only event-four thousand people each pay six thousand dollars, and many others are turned away. If you can countenance the summer-camp ethos-attendees refer to each other as TEDsters and TEDizens-the group does manage to herd together many of the most interesting people in the world. It is one of the few places on earth where you can see Bill Clinton, E. O. Wilson, or Philippe Starck chatting amiably with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Cameron Diaz, or Paul Simon. This year's theme was ""Icons, Geniuses and Mavericks,"" and on the final day of the conference its organizer, Chris Anderson, interviewed Richard Branson before a rapt, capacity crowd.It was early on a Saturday morning, and Branson looked a little ragged. He had been out the night before with several people from Google, including one of the founders, Sergey Brin. When there didn't seem to be enough room in the car, Branson jumped into the trunk and curled up there. As Anderson ran through Branson's r"
"6","Article 6","The predicted effects of global warming in Maryland are scary: the Chesapeake Bay spilling over its shores, stronger storms and a shake-up of the species that can survive here.Some experts say the relative sea level rise here could be more than 2 feet by the end of the century, flooding many low-lying areas of Anne Arundel and Queen Anne's counties.And that potential fallout has some lawmakers in Annapolis concerned - and inspired to do something about it.""Thirty years ago, people called global warming science fiction,"" Sen. Paul Pinsky told his colleagues in Annapolis last week. ""Today, scientists around the globe simply call it science.""As Mr. Pinsky pitched his plan for Maryland to combat global warming, the main question in the room wasn't whether or not global warming is a problem. The central question was: Should Maryland residents and businesses be forced to do something about it?Mr. Pinsky, a Prince George's Democrat, is sponsoring a bill that would require the state to cut its emissions of global warming-causing greenhouse gases back to 1990 levels by 2020.The bill doesn't say exactly how the state should make the reductions. Instead, it gives wide latitude to the Maryland Department of the Environment and a new state Office of Climate Change to figure it out.Some supporters are calling the bill the ""Schwarzenegger Plan,"" because it's modeled after a law passed in California that was championed there by Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.Mr. Pinsky's bill faces uncertain odds, though it does boast about 60 cosponsors between the state Senate and the House of Delegates. If it doesn't pass, the senator promises to keep bringing it back until it does.He's convinced that the time has come for Maryland to make a serious attempt at cutting down on greenhouse gas emissions. And he believes the tide is swinging his way.""There really has been a culture of change of people being more keenly aware,"" Mr. Pinsky said in an interview.'Count on it'According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, global warming occurs when certain gases, such as carbon dioxide, get trapped in the earth's atmosphere. Those gases trap heat, instead of allowing it to dissipate away from Earth - thus the nickname, ""greenhouse effect.""The result is increased air temperature and melting of glaciers and ice caps. Those, in turn, can lead to sea level rise and changes in the climate around the globe - including the possibility of more frequent or more severe storms.An international group that studies the matter, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, recently issued a report that said it is ""very likely"" that human activities are contributing to warming.Those activities include burning fossil fuels, mainly through creating electricity and driving vehicles. Other man-made sources of greenhouse gases include industry, agriculture and waste management, according to the EPA.The IPCC report predicted a 7-inch to 23-inch sea level rise by the end of the century, as well as a 2 to 11.5 degree Fahrenheit air temperature rise.While many policymakers and politicians want a 100 percent guarantee from scientists, that rarely happens in science, said Dr. Donald Boesch, president of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science.But the language in the IPCC report is quite strong and leaves very little room for doubt, said Dr. Boesch, an oceanographer who has worked in both the Chesapeake Bay and in Louisiana.""Scientists have been very cautious about what they've concluded, so you can't allege easily they've overplayed their case,"" he said.Like it or not, that sea level rise is a certainty in the Chesapeake Bay, Dr. Boesch said.""I would think you'd better plan for it,"" he said. ""You better count on it.""Gauging the impactGlobal warming and sea level rise should be particularly worrisome to Marylanders, experts say.That's because as the waters are rising, the state's land is sinking due to geologic forces. When you add the two together, the potential ""relative sea level rise"" is dramatic.Zoe Johnson, a coastal planner at the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, said Maryland's relative sea level rise could be 12 to 28 inches during the next century.That foot or two of water could reshape the coastlines of Maryland's bay and rivers. Wetlands could become submerged and water could creep closer to homes, Ms. Johnson said.And on top of that, more water in the bay can translate to more damage from hurricanes, tropical storms and nor'easters, Ms. Johnson said.That could mean more flooding or more storm damage at low-lying places like the Annapolis City Dock, she said.And if the waters are warmer as well due to global warming, that means storms will be able to maintain strength further up the coast during hurricane season.Dr. Michael Kearney, a coastal geology professor at the University of Maryland, College Park, testified last week that damage from storms like 2003's Tropical Storm Isabel could be a more common occurrence.""Isabel was pretty much a wake-up call of what we could expect and what we should expect,"" he said.The Department of Natural Resources is helping local governments to plan for those kind of scenarios - tackling issues such as whether to allow more shoreline development. Most recently, the DNR has been working with some Eastern Shore communities.The DNR plans to work with Anne Arundel County planners as they begin to revise the county's long-term development plan later this year.""Sea level rise has so many impacts. We're trying to integrate sea level rise into all planning,"" Ms. Johnson said.'Huge step'As planning gets under way to cope with sea level rise, the political efforts like Mr. Pinsky's continue to try and prevent it from happening.Gov. Martin O'Malley's administration supports the bill with some modifications aimed at making it easier and less expensive to enact.Tad Aburn, the state's top air quality official, said Mr. Pinsky's bill complements last year's Healthy Air Act and the Clean Cars Act, which is headed toward approval this week. Both acts will lead to a reduction in carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas.Critics of such efforts, however, point out that Maryland is a very small state. Even major reductions in a small state will do little to change the global problem of climate change - something that supporters acknowledge.Representatives from business and industrial groups testified this week that a national greenhouse gas program is the way to go.Michael Powell, a lobbyist representing the Maryland Industrial Technology Alliance, questioned the vague nature of the bill during a hearing in Annapolis last week.Mr. Powell criticized the bill for giving a ""blank check"" to the Maryland Department of the Environment to create a greenhouse gas reduction plan.And he said cutting back to 1990 levels would be severe, and could drive companies that have emissions out of the state.""That is a draconian, huge, huge step,"" he said.But others testified that the reductions could help the economy in the long run. Marylanders would likely end up using less energy, therefore saving money.And there still appear to be some global warming skeptics in the General Assembly. During the bill hearing, Republican Sens. Richard E. Colburn and Andrew P. Harris peppered scientists with questions about the validity of global warming claims.""It seems to me there's always been storms, there's always been hurricanes,"" said Mr. Colburn, who is from low-lying Dorchester County on the Eastern Shore.The debate over the bill will be rehashed in March, when members of two House of Delegates committees take up the bill.Mr. Pinsky urged his fellow lawmakers to support the bill as a means of encouraging other states - and perhaps the federal government - to join in fighting global warming.""Some may ask why should an individual state like Maryland set a policy on global problem ... Unfortunately, the United States government has not set limits, so it falls to us,"" he said. Global Warming Solutions ActThe bill would:Establish an Office of Climate Change within the Maryland Department of the Environment.Require MDE to come up with a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels.Allow MDE to levy fees on sources of greenhouse gases.Have little or no effect on global warming, but supporters say it would influence other states or the federal government to act, too."
"7","Article 7","Thirty years ago, we had a chance to save the planet.The science of climate change was settled. The world was ready to act.Almost nothing stood in our way -- except ourselves.--Editor's NoteThis narrative by Nathaniel Rich is a work of history, addressing the 10-year period from 1979 to 1989: the decisive decade when humankind first came to a broad understanding of the causes and dangers of climate change. Complementing the text is a series of aerial photographs and videos, all shot over the past year by George Steinmetz. With support from the Pulitzer Center, this two-part article is based on 18 months of reporting and well over a hundred interviews. It tracks the efforts of a small group of American scientists, activists and politicians to raise the alarm and stave off catastrophe. It will come as a revelation to many readers -- an agonizing revelation -- to understand how thoroughly they grasped the problem and how close they came to solving it. Jake SilversteinPrologueThe world has warmed more than one degree Celsius since the Industrial Revolution. The Paris climate agreement -- the nonbinding, unenforceable and already unheeded treaty signed on Earth Day in 2016 -- hoped to restrict warming to two degrees. The odds of succeeding, according to a recent study based on current emissions trends, are one in 20. If by some miracle we are able to limit warming to two degrees, we will only have to negotiate the extinction of the world's tropical reefs, sea-level rise of several meters and the abandonment of the Persian Gulf. The climate scientist James Hansen has called two-degree warming ''a prescription for long-term disaster.'' Long-term disaster is now the best-case scenario. Three-degree warming is a prescription for short-term disaster: forests in the Arctic and the loss of most coastal cities. Robert Watson, a former director of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has argued that three-degree warming is the realistic minimum. Four degrees: Europe in permanent drought; vast areas of China, India and Bangladesh claimed by desert; Polynesia swallowed by the sea; the Colorado River thinned to a trickle; the American Southwest largely uninhabitable. The prospect of a five-degree warming has prompted some of the world's leading climate scientists to warn of the end of human civilization.Is it a comfort or a curse, the knowledge that we could have avoided all this?Because in the decade that ran from 1979 to 1989, we had an excellent opportunity to solve the climate crisis. The world's major powers came within several signatures of endorsing a binding, global framework to reduce carbon emissions -- far closer than we've come since. During those years, the conditions for success could not have been more favorable. The obstacles we blame for our current inaction had yet to emerge. Almost nothing stood in our way -- nothing except ourselves.Nearly everything we understand about global warming was understood in 1979. By that year, data collected since 1957 confirmed what had been known since before the turn of the 20th century: Human beings have altered Earth's atmosphere through the indiscriminate burning of fossil fuels. The main scientific questions were settled beyond debate, and as the 1980s began, attention turned from diagnosis of the problem to refinement of the predicted consequences. Compared with string theory and genetic engineering, the ''greenhouse effect'' -- a metaphor dating to the early 1900s -- was ancient history, described in any Introduction to Biology textbook. Nor was the basic science especially complicated. It could be reduced to a simple axiom: The more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, the warmer the planet. And every year, by burning coal, oil and gas, humankind belched increasingly obscene quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.Why didn't we act? A common boogeyman today is the fossil-fuel industry, which in recent decades has committed to playing the role of villain with comic-book bravado. An entire subfield of climate literature has chronicled the machinations of industry lobbyists, the corruption of scientists and the propaganda campaigns that even now continue to debase the political debate, long after the largest oil-and-gas companies have abandoned the dumb show of denialism. But the coordinated efforts to bewilder the public did not begin in earnest until the end of 1989. During the preceding decade, some of the largest oil companies, including Exxon and Shell, made good-faith efforts to understand the scope of the crisis and grapple with possible solutions.Nor can the Republican Party be blamed. Today, only 42 percent of Republicans know that ''most scientists believe global warming is occurring,'' and that percentage is falling. But during the 1980s, many prominent Republicans joined Democrats in judging the climate problem to be a rare political winner: nonpartisan and of the highest possible stakes. Among those who called for urgent, immediate and far-reaching climate policy were Senators John Chafee, Robert Stafford and David Durenberger; the E.P.A. administrator, William K. Reilly; and, during his campaign for president, George H.W. Bush. As Malcolm Forbes Baldwin, the acting chairman of the president's Council for Environmental Quality, told industry executives in 1981, ''There can be no more important or conservative concern than the protection of the globe itself.'' The issue was unimpeachable, like support for veterans or small business. Except the climate had an even broader constituency, composed of every human being on Earth.It was understood that action would have to come immediately. At the start of the 1980s, scientists within the federal government predicted that conclusive evidence of warming would appear on the global temperature record by the end of the decade, at which point it would be too late to avoid disaster. More than 30 percent of the human population lacked access to electricity. Billions of people would not need to attain the ''American way of life'' in order to drastically increase global carbon emissions; a light bulb in every village would do it. A report prepared at the request of the White House by the National Academy of Sciences advised that ''the carbon-dioxide issue should appear on the international agenda in a context that will maximize cooperation and consensus-building and minimize political manipulation, controversy and division.'' If the world had adopted the proposal widely endorsed at the end of the '80s -- a freezing of carbon emissions, with a reduction of 20 percent by 2005 -- warming could have been held to less than 1.5 degrees.A broad international consensus had settled on a solution: a global treaty to curb carbon emissions. The idea began to coalesce as early as February 1979, at the first World Climate Conference in Geneva, when scientists from 50 nations agreed unanimously that it was ''urgently necessary'' to act. Four months later, at the Group of 7 meeting in Tokyo, the leaders of the world's seven wealthiest nations signed a statement resolving to reduce carbon emissions. Ten years later, the first major diplomatic meeting to approve the framework for a binding treaty was called in the Netherlands. Delegates from more than 60 nations attended, with the goal of establishing a global summit meeting to be held about a year later. Among scientists and world leaders, the sentiment was unanimous: Action had to be taken, and the United States would need to lead. It didn't.The inaugural chapter of the climate-change saga is over. In that chapter -- call it Apprehension -- we identified the threat and its consequences. We spoke, with increasing urgency and self-delusion, of the prospect of triumphing against long odds. But we did not seriously consider the prospect of failure. We understood what failure would mean for global temperatures, coastlines, agricultural yield, immigration patterns, the world economy. But we have not allowed ourselves to comprehend what failure might mean for us. How will it change the way we see ourselves, how we remember the past, how we imagine the future? Why did we do this to ourselves? These questions will be the subject of climate change's second chapter -- call it The Reckoning. There can be no understanding of our current and future predicament without understanding why we failed to solve this problem when we had the chance.That we came so close, as a civilization, to breaking our suicide pact with fossil fuels can be credited to the efforts of a handful of people, among them a hyperkinetic lobbyist and a guileless atmospheric physicist who, at great personal cost, tried to warn humanity of what was coming. They risked their careers in a painful, escalating campaign to solve the problem, first in scientific reports, later through conventional avenues of political persuasion and finally with a strategy of public shaming. Their efforts were shrewd, passionate, robust. And they failed. What follows is their story, and ours.Part One 1979--19821. 'This Is the Whole Banana' Spring 1979The first suggestion to Rafe Pomerance that humankind was destroying the conditions necessary for its own survival came on Page 66 of the government publication EPA-600/7-78-019. It was a technical report about coal, bound in a coal-black cover with beige lettering -- one of many such reports that lay in uneven piles around Pomerance's windowless office on the first floor of the Capitol Hill townhouse that, in the late 1970s, served as the Washington headquarters of Friends of the Earth. In the final paragraph of a chapter on environmental regulation, the coal report's authors noted that the continued use of fossil fuels might, within two or three decades, bring about ''significant and damaging'' changes to the global atmosphere.Pomerance paused, startled, over the orphaned paragraph. It seemed to have come out of nowhere. He reread it. It made no sense to him. Pomerance was not a scientist; he graduated from Cornell 11 years earlier with a degree in history. He had the tweedy appearance of an undernourished doctoral student emerging at dawn from the stacks. He wore horn-rimmed glasses and a thickish mustache that wilted disapprovingly over the corners of his mouth, though his defining characteristic was his gratuitous height, 6 feet 4 inches, which seemed to embarrass him; he stooped over to accommodate his interlocutors. He had an active face prone to breaking out in wide, even maniacal grins, but in composure, as when he read the coal pamphlet, it projected concern. He struggled with technical reports. He proceeded as a historian might: cautiously, scrutinizing the source material, reading between the lines. When that failed, he made phone calls, often to the authors of the reports, who tended to be surprised to hear from him. Scientists, he had found, were not in the habit of fielding questions from political lobbyists. They were not in the habit of thinking about politics.Pomerance had one big question about the coal report. If the burning of coal, oil and natural gas could invite global catastrophe, why had nobody told him about it? If anyone in Washington -- if anyone in the United States -- should have been aware of such a danger, it was Pomerance. As the deputy legislative director of Friends of the Earth, the wily, pugnacious nonprofit that David Brower helped found after resigning from the Sierra Club a decade earlier, Pomerance was one of the nation's most connected environmental activists. That he was as easily accepted in the halls of the Dirksen Senate Office Building as at Earth Day rallies might have had something to do with the fact that he was a Morgenthau -- the great-grandson of Henry Sr., Woodrow Wilson's ambassador to the Ottoman Empire; great-nephew of Henry Jr., Franklin D. Roosevelt's Treasury secretary; second cousin to Robert, district attorney for Manhattan. Or perhaps it was just his charisma -- voluble, energetic and obsessive, he seemed to be everywhere, speaking with everyone, in a very loud voice, at once. His chief obsession was air. After working as an organizer for welfare rights, he spent the second half of his 20s laboring to protect and expand the Clean Air Act, the comprehensive law regulating air pollution. That led him to the problem of acid rain, and the coal report.He showed the unsettling paragraph to his office mate, Betsy Agle. Had she ever heard of the ''greenhouse effect''? Was it really possible that human beings were overheating the planet?Agle shrugged. She hadn't heard about it, either.That might have been the end of it, had Agle not greeted Pomerance in the office a few mornings later holding a copy of a newspaper forwarded by Friends of the Earth's Denver office. Isn't this what you were talking about the other day? she asked.Agle pointed to an article about a prominent geophysicist named Gordon MacDonald, who was conducting a study on climate change with the Jasons, the mysterious coterie of elite scientists to which he belonged. Pomerance hadn't heard of MacDonald, but he knew all about the Jasons. They were like one of those teams of superheroes with complementary powers that join forces in times of galactic crisis. They had been brought together by federal agencies, including the C.I.A, to devise scientific solutions to national-security problems: how to detect an incoming missile; how to predict fallout from a nuclear bomb; how to develop unconventional weapons, like plague-infested rats. The Jasons' activities had been a secret until the publication of the Pentagon Papers, which exposed their plan to festoon the Ho Chi Minh Trail with motion sensors that signaled to bombers. After the furor that followed -- protesters set MacDonald's garage on fire -- the Jasons began to use their powers for peace instead of war.There was an urgent problem that demanded their attention, MacDonald believed, because human civilization faced an existential crisis. In ''How to Wreck the Environment,'' a 1968 essay published while he was a science adviser to Lyndon Johnson, MacDonald predicted a near future in which ''nuclear weapons were effectively banned and the weapons of mass destruction were those of environmental catastrophe.'' One of the most potentially devastating such weapons, he believed, was the gas that we exhaled with every breath: carbon dioxide. By vastly increasing carbon emissions, the world's most advanced militaries could alter weather patterns and wreak famine, drought and economic collapse.In the decade since then, MacDonald had been alarmed to see humankind begin in earnest to weaponize weather -- not out of malice, but unwittingly. During the spring of 1977 and the summer of 1978, the Jasons met to determine what would happen once the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubled from pre-Industrial Revolution levels. It was an arbitrary milestone, the doubling, but a useful one, as its inevitability was not in question; the threshold would most likely be breached by 2035. The Jasons' report to the Department of Energy, ''The Long-Term Impact of Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide on Climate,'' was written in an understated tone that only enhanced its nightmarish findings: Global temperatures would increase by an average of two to three degrees Celsius; Dust Bowl conditions would ''threaten large areas of North America, Asia and Africa''; access to drinking water and agricultural production would fall, triggering mass migration on an unprecedented scale. ''Perhaps the most ominous feature,'' however, was the effect of a changing climate on the poles. Even a minimal warming ''could lead to rapid melting'' of the West Antarctic ice sheet. The ice sheet contained enough water to raise the level of the oceans 16 feet.The Jasons sent the report to dozens of scientists in the United States and abroad; to industry groups like the National Coal Association and the Electric Power Research Institute; and within the government, to the National Academy of Sciences, the Commerce Department, the E.P.A., NASA, the Pentagon, the N.S.A., every branch of the military, the National Security Council and the White House.Pomerance read about the atmospheric crisis in a state of shock that swelled briskly into outrage. ''This,'' he told Betsy Agle, ''is the whole banana.''Gordon MacDonald worked at the federally funded Mitre Corporation, a think tank that works with agencies throughout the government. His title was senior research analyst, which was another way of saying senior science adviser to the national-intelligence community. After a single phone call, Pomerance, a former Vietnam War protester and conscientious objector, drove several miles on the Beltway to a group of anonymous white office buildings that more closely resembled the headquarters of a regional banking firm than the solar plexus of the American military-industrial complex. He was shown into the office of a brawny, soft-spoken man in blocky, horn-rimmed frames, who extended a hand like a bear's paw.''I'm glad you're interested in this,'' MacDonald said, sizing up the young activist.''How could I not be?'' Pomerance said. ''How could anyone not be?''MacDonald explained that he first studied the carbon-dioxide issue when he was about Pomerance's age -- in 1961, when he served as an adviser to John F. Kennedy. Pomerance pieced together that MacDonald, in his youth, had been something of a prodigy: In his 20s, he advised Dwight D. Eisenhower on space exploration; at 32, he became a member of the National Academy of Sciences; at 40, he was appointed to the inaugural Council on Environmental Quality, where he advised Richard Nixon on the environmental dangers of burning coal. He monitored the carbon-dioxide problem the whole time, with increasing alarm.MacDonald spoke for two hours. Pomerance was appalled. ''If I set up briefings with some people on the Hill,'' he asked MacDonald, ''will you tell them what you just told me?''Thus began the Gordon and Rafe carbon-dioxide roadshow. Beginning in the spring of 1979, Pomerance arranged informal briefings with the E.P.A., the National Security Council, The New York Times, the Council on Environmental Quality and the Energy Department, which, Pomerance learned, had established an Office of Carbon Dioxide Effects two years earlier at MacDonald's urging. The men settled into a routine, with MacDonald explaining the science and Pomerance adding the exclamation points. They were surprised to learn how few senior officials were familiar with the Jasons' findings, let alone understood the ramifications of global warming. At last, having worked their way up the federal hierarchy, the two went to see the president's top scientist, Frank Press.Press's office was in the Old Executive Office Building, the granite fortress that stands on the White House grounds just paces away from the West Wing. Out of respect for MacDonald, Press had summoned to their meeting what seemed to be the entire senior staff of the president's Office of Science and Technology Policy -- the officials consulted on every critical matter of energy and national security. What Pomerance had expected to be yet another casual briefing assumed the character of a high-level national-security meeting. He decided to let MacDonald do all the talking. There was no need to emphasize to Press and his lieutenants that this was an issue of profound national significance. The hushed mood in the office told him that this was already understood.To explain what the carbon-dioxide problem meant for the future, MacDonald would begin his presentation by going back more than a century to John Tyndall -- an Irish physicist who was an early champion of Charles Darwin's work and died after being accidentally poisoned by his wife. In 1859, Tyndall found that carbon dioxide absorbed heat and that variations in the composition of the atmosphere could create changes in climate. These findings inspired Svante Arrhenius, a Swedish chemist and future Nobel laureate, to deduce in 1896 that the combustion of coal and petroleum could raise global temperatures. This warming would become noticeable in a few centuries, Arrhenius calculated, or sooner if consumption of fossil fuels continued to increase.Consumption increased beyond anything the Swedish chemist could have imagined. Four decades later, a British steam engineer named Guy Stewart Callendar discovered that, at the weather stations he observed, the previous five years were the hottest in recorded history. Humankind, he wrote in a paper, had become ''able to speed up the processes of Nature.'' That was in 1939.MacDonald's voice was calm but authoritative, his powerful, heavy hands conveying the force of his argument. He was a geophysicist trapped in the body of an offensive lineman -- he had turned down a football scholarship to Rice in order to attend Harvard -- and seemed miscast as a preacher of atmospheric physics and existential doom. His audience listened in bowed silence. Pomerance couldn't read them. Political bureaucrats were skilled at hiding their opinions. Pomerance wasn't. He shifted restlessly in his chair, glancing between MacDonald and the government suits, trying to see whether they grasped the shape of the behemoth that MacDonald was describing.MacDonald's history concluded with Roger Revelle, perhaps the most distinguished of the priestly caste of government scientists who, since the Manhattan Project, advised every president on major policy; he had been a close colleague of MacDonald and Press since they served together under Kennedy. In a 1957 paper written with Hans Suess, Revelle concluded that ''human beings are now carrying out a large-scale geophysical experiment of a kind that could not have happened in the past nor be reproduced in the future.'' Revelle helped the Weather Bureau establish a continuous measurement of atmospheric carbon dioxide at a site perched near the summit of Mauna Loa on the Big Island of Hawaii, 11,500 feet above the sea -- a rare pristine natural laboratory on a planet blanketed by fossil-fuel emissions. A young geochemist named Charles David Keeling charted the data. Keeling's graph came to be known as the Keeling curve, though it more closely resembled a jagged lightning bolt hurled toward the firmament. MacDonald had a habit of tracing the Keeling curve in the air, his thick forefinger jabbing toward the ceiling.After nearly a decade of observation, Revelle had shared his concerns with Lyndon Johnson, who included them in a special message to Congress two weeks after his inauguration. Johnson explained that his generation had ''altered the composition of the atmosphere on a global scale'' through the burning of fossil fuels, and his administration commissioned a study of the subject by his Science Advisory Committee. Revelle was its chairman, and its 1965 executive report on carbon dioxide warned of the rapid melting of Antarctica, rising seas, increased acidity of fresh waters -- changes that would require no less than a coordinated global effort to forestall.In 1974, the C.I.A. issued a classified report on the carbon-dioxide problem. It concluded that climate change had begun around 1960 and had ''already caused major economic problems throughout the world.'' The future economic and political impacts would be ''almost beyond comprehension.'' Yet emissions continued to rise, and at this rate, MacDonald warned, they could see a snowless New England, the swamping of major coastal cities, as much as a 40 percent decline in national wheat production, the forced migration of about one-quarter of the world's population. Not within centuries -- within their own lifetimes.''What would you have us do?'' Press asked.The president's plan, in the wake of the Saudi oil crisis, to promote solar energy -- he had gone so far as to install 32 solar panels on the roof of the White House to heat his family's water -- was a good start, MacDonald thought. But Jimmy Carter's plan to stimulate production of synthetic fuels -- gas and liquid fuel extracted from shale and tar sands -- was a dangerous idea. Nuclear power, despite the recent tragedy at Three Mile Island, should be expanded. But even natural gas and ethanol were preferable to coal. There was no way around it: Coal production would ultimately have to end.The president's advisers asked respectful questions, but Pomerance couldn't tell whether they were persuaded. The men all stood and shook hands, and Press led MacDonald and Pomerance out of his office. After they emerged from the Old Executive Office Building onto Pennsylvania Avenue, Pomerance asked MacDonald what he thought would happen.Knowing Frank as I do, MacDonald said, I really couldn't tell you.In the days that followed, Pomerance grew uneasy. Until this point, he had fixated on the science of the carbon-dioxide issue and its possible political ramifications. But now that his meetings on Capitol Hill had concluded, he began to question what all this might mean for his own future. His wife, Lenore, was eight months pregnant; was it ethical, he wondered, to bring a child onto a planet that before much longer could become inhospitable to life? And he wondered why it had fallen to him, a 32-year-old lobbyist without scientific training, to bring greater attention to this crisis.Finally, weeks later, MacDonald called to tell him that Press had taken up the issue. On May 22, Press wrote a letter to the president of the National Academy of Sciences requesting a full assessment of the carbon-dioxide issue. Jule Charney, the father of modern meteorology, would gather the nation's top oceanographers, atmospheric scientists and climate modelers to judge whether MacDonald's alarm was justified -- whether the world was, in fact, headed to cataclysm.Pomerance was amazed by how much momentum had built in such a short time. Scientists at the highest levels of government had known about the dangers of fossil-fuel combustion for decades. Yet they had produced little besides journal articles, academic symposiums, technical reports. Nor had any politician, journalist or activist championed the issue. That, Pomerance figured, was about to change. If Charney's group confirmed that the world was careering toward an existential crisis, the president would be forced to act.2. The Whimsies of The Invisible World Spring 1979There was a brown velvet love seat in the living room of James and Anniek Hansen, under a bright window looking out on Morningside Park in Manhattan, that nobody ever sat in. Erik, their 2-year-old son, was forbidden to go near it. The ceiling above the couch sagged ominously, as if pregnant with some alien life form, and the bulge grew with each passing week. Jim promised Anniek that he would fix it, which was only fair, because it had been on his insistence that they gave up the prospect of a prewar apartment in Spuyten Duyvil overlooking the Hudson and moved from Riverdale to this two-story walk-up with crumbling walls, police-siren lullabies and gravid ceiling. Jim had resented the 45-minute commute to NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in Manhattan and complained that such a gross waste of his time would soon be unsustainable, once the Pioneer spacecraft reached Venus and began to beam back data. But even after the Hansens moved within a few blocks of the institute, Jim couldn't make time for the ceiling, and after four months it finally burst, releasing a confetti of browned pipes and splintered wood.Jim repeated his vow to fix the ceiling as soon as he had a moment free from work. Anniek held him to his word, though it required her to live with a hole in her ceiling until Thanksgiving -- seven months of plaster dust powdering the love seat.Another promise Jim made to Anniek: He would make it home for dinner every night by 7 p.m. By 8:30, however, he was back at his calculations. Anniek did not begrudge him his deep commitment to his work; it was one of the things she loved about him. Still, it baffled her that the subject of his obsession should be the atmospheric conditions of a planet more than 24 million miles away. It baffled Jim, too. His voyage to Venus from Denison, Iowa, the fifth child of a diner waitress and an itinerant farmer turned bartender, had been a series of bizarre twists of fate over which he claimed no agency. It was just something that happened to him.Hansen figured he was the only scientist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration who, as a child, did not dream of outer space. He dreamed only of baseball. On clear nights, his transistor radio picked up the broadcast of the Kansas City Blues, the New York Yankees' AAA affiliate. Every morning, he cut out the box scores, pasted them into a notebook and tallied statistics. Hansen found comfort in numbers and equations. He majored in math and physics at the University of Iowa, but he never would have taken an interest in celestial matters were it not for the unlikely coincidence of two events during the year he graduated: the eruption of a volcano in Bali and a total eclipse of the moon.On the night of Dec. 30, 1963 -- whipping wind, 12 degrees below zero -- Hansen accompanied his astronomy professor to a cornfield far from town. They set a telescope in an old corncrib and, between 2 and 8 in the morning, made continuous photoelectric recordings of the eclipse, pausing only when the extension cord froze and when they dashed to the car for a few minutes to avoid frostbite.During an eclipse, the moon resembles a tangerine or, if the eclipse is total, a drop of blood. But this night, the moon vanished altogether. Hansen made the mystery the subject of his master's thesis, concluding that the moon had been obscured by the dust erupted into the atmosphere by Mount Agung, on the other side of the planet from his corncrib, six months earlier. The discovery led to his fascination with the influence of invisible particles on the visible world. You could not make sense of the visible world until you understood the whimsies of the invisible one.One of the leading authorities on the invisible world happened to be teaching then at Iowa: James Van Allen made the first major discovery of the space age, identifying the two doughnut-shaped regions of convulsing particles that circle Earth, now known as the Van Allen belts. At Van Allen's prodding, Hansen turned from the moon to Venus. Why, he tried to determine, was its surface so hot? In 1967, a Soviet satellite beamed back the answer: The planet's atmosphere was mainly carbon dioxide. Though once it may have had habitable temperatures, it was believed to have succumbed to a runaway greenhouse effect: As the sun grew brighter, Venus's ocean began to evaporate, thickening the atmosphere, which forced yet greater evaporation -- a self-perpetuating cycle that finally boiled off the ocean entirely and heated the planet's surface to more than 800 degrees Fahrenheit. At the other extreme, Mars's thin atmosphere had insufficient carbon dioxide to trap much heat at all, leaving it about 900 degrees colder. Earth lay in the middle, its Goldilocks greenhouse effect just strong enough to support life.Anniek expected Jim's professional life to resume some semblance of normality once the data from Venus had been collected and analyzed. But shortly after Pioneer entered Venus's atmosphere, Hansen came home from the office in an uncharacteristic fervor -- with an apology. The prospect of two or three more years of intense work had sprung up before him. NASA was expanding its study of Earth's atmospheric conditions. Hansen had already done some work on Earth's atmosphere for Jule Charney at the Goddard Institute, helping to develop computerized weather models. Now Hansen would have an opportunity to apply to Earth the lessons he had learned from Venus.We want to learn more about Earth's climate, Jim told Anniek -- and how humanity can influence it. He would use giant new supercomputers to map the planet's atmosphere. They would create Mirror Worlds: parallel realities that mimicked our own. These digital simulacra, technically called ''general circulation models,'' combined the mathematical formulas that governed the behavior of the sea, land and sky into a single computer model. Unlike the real world, they could be sped forward to reveal the future.Anniek's disappointment -- another several years of distraction, stress, time spent apart from family -- was tempered, if only slightly, by the high strain of Jim's enthusiasm. She thought she understood it. Does this mean, she asked, that you'll able to predict weather more accurately?Yes, Jim said. Something like that.3. Between Catastrophe and Chaos July 1979The scientists summoned by Jule Charney to judge the fate of civilization arrived on July 23, 1979, with their wives, children and weekend bags at a three-story mansion in Woods Hole, on the southwestern spur of Cape Cod. They would review all the available science and decide whether the White House should take seriously Gordon MacDonald's prediction of a climate apocalypse. The Jasons had predicted a warming of two or three degrees Celsius by the middle of the 21st century, but like Roger Revelle before them, they emphasized their reasons for uncertainty. Charney's scientists were asked to quantify that uncertainty. They had to get it right: Their conclusion would be delivered to the president. But first they would hold a clambake.They gathered with their families on a bluff overlooking Quissett Harbor and took turns tossing mesh produce bags stuffed with lobster, clams and corn into a bubbling caldron. While the children scrambled across the rolling lawn, the scientists mingled with a claque of visiting dignitaries, whose status lay somewhere between chaperone and client -- men from the Departments of State, Energy, Defense and Agriculture; the E.P.A.; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. They exchanged pleasantries and took in the sunset. It was a hot day, high 80s, but the harbor breeze was salty and cool. It didn't look like the dawning of an apocalypse. The government officials, many of them scientists themselves, tried to suppress their awe of the legends in their presence: Henry Stommel, the world's leading oceanographer; his prot쎩g쎩, Carl Wunsch, a Jason; the Manhattan Project alumnus Cecil Leith; the Harvard planetary physicist Richard Goody. These were the men who, in the last three decades, had discovered foundational principles underlying the relationships among sun, atmosphere, land and ocean -- which is to say, the climate.The hierarchy was made visible during the workshop sessions, held in the carriage house next door: The scientists sat at tables arranged in a rectangle, while their federal observers sat along the room's perimeter, taking in the action as at a theater in the round. The first two days of meetings didn't make very good theater, however, as the scientists reviewed the basic principles of the carbon cycle, ocean circulation, radiative transfer. On the third day, Charney introduced a new prop: a black speaker, attached to a telephone. He dialed, and Jim Hansen answered.Charney called Hansen because he had grasped that in order to determine the exact range of future warming, his group would have to venture into the realm of the Mirror Worlds. Jule Charney himself had used a general circulation model to revolutionize weather prediction. But Hansen was one of just a few modelers who had studied the effects of carbon emissions. When, at Charney's request, Hansen programmed his model to consider a future of doubled carbon dioxide, it predicted a temperature increase of four degrees Celsius. That was twice as much warming as the prediction made by the most prominent climate modeler, Syukuro Manabe, whose government lab at Princeton was the first to model the greenhouse effect. The difference between the two predictions -- between warming of two degrees Celsius and four degrees Celsius -- was the difference between damaged coral reefs and no reefs whatsoever, between thinning forests and forests enveloped by desert, between catastrophe and chaos.In the carriage house, the disembodied voice of Jim Hansen explained, in a quiet, matter-of-fact tone, how his model weighed the influences of clouds, oceans and snow on warming. The older scientists interrupted, shouting questions; when they did not transmit through the telephone, Charney repeated them in a bellow. The questions kept coming, often before their younger respondent could finish his answers, and Hansen wondered if it wouldn't have been easier for him to drive the five hours and meet with them in person.Among Charney's group was Akio Arakawa, a pioneer of computer modeling. On the final night at Woods Hole, Arakawa stayed up in his motel room with printouts from the models by Hansen and Manabe blanketing his double bed. The discrepancy between the models, Arakawa concluded, came down to ice and snow. The whiteness of the world's snowfields reflected light; if snow melted in a warmer climate, less radiation would escape the atmosphere, leading to even greater warming. Shortly before dawn, Arakawa concluded that Manabe had given too little weight to the influence of melting sea ice, while Hansen had overemphasized it. The best estimate lay in between. Which meant that the Jasons' calculation was too optimistic. When carbon dioxide doubled in 2035 or thereabouts, global temperatures would increase between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees Celsius, with the most likely outcome a warming of three degrees.The publication of Jule Charney's report, ''Carbon Dioxide and Climate: A Scientific Assessment,'' several months later was not accompanied by a banquet, a parade or even a news conference. Yet within the highest levels of the federal government, the scientific community and the oil-and-gas industry -- within the commonwealth of people who had begun to concern themselves with the future habitability of the planet -- the Charney report would come to have the authority of settled fact. It was the summation of all the predictions that had come before, and it would withstand the scrutiny of the decades that followed it. Charney's group had considered everything known about ocean, sun, sea, air and fossil fuels and had distilled it to a single number: three. When the doubling threshold was broached, as appeared inevitable, the world would warm three degrees Celsius. The last time the world was three degrees warmer was during the Pliocene, three million years ago, when beech trees grew in Antarctica, the seas were 80 feet higher and horses galloped across the Canadian coast of the Arctic Ocean.The Charney report left Jim Hansen with more urgent questions. Three degrees would be nightmarish, and unless carbon emissions ceased suddenly, three degrees would be only the beginning. The real question was whether the warming trend could be reversed. Was there time to act? And how would a global commitment to cease burning fossil fuels come about, exactly? Who had the power to make such a thing happen? Hansen didn't know how to begin to answer these questions. But he would learn.4. 'A Very Aggressive Defensive Program' Summer 1979-Summer 1980After the publication of the Charney report, Exxon decided to create its own dedicated carbon-dioxide research program, with an annual budget of $600,000. Only Exxon was asking a slightly different question than Jule Charney. Exxon didn't concern itself primarily with how much the world would warm. It wanted to know how much of the warming Exxon could be blamed for.A senior researcher named Henry Shaw had argued that the company needed a deeper understanding of the issue in order to influence future legislation that might restrict carbon-dioxide emissions. ''It behooves us to start a very aggressive defensive program,'' Shaw wrote in a memo to a manager, ''because there is a good probability that legislation affecting our business will be passed.''Shaw turned to Wallace Broecker, a Columbia University oceanographer who was the second author of Roger Revelle's 1965 carbon-dioxide report for Lyndon Johnson. In 1977, in a presentation at the American Geophysical Union, Broecker predicted that fossil fuels would have to be restricted, whether by taxation or fiat. More recently, he had testified before Congress, calling carbon dioxide ''the No.1 long-term environmental problem.'' If presidents and senators trusted Broecker to tell them the bad news, he was good enough for Exxon.The company had been studying the carbon-dioxide problem for decades, since before it changed its name to Exxon. In 1957, scientists from Humble Oil published a study tracking ''the enormous quantity of carbon dioxide'' contributed to the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution ''from the combustion of fossil fuels.'' Even then, the observation that burning fossil fuels had increased the concentration of carbon in the atmosphere was well understood and accepted by Humble's scientists. What was new, in 1957, was the effort to quantify what percentage of emissions had been contributed by the oil-and-gas industry.The American Petroleum Institute, the industry's largest trade association, asked the same question in 1958 through its air-pollution study group and replicated the findings made by Humble Oil. So did another A.P.I. study conducted by the Stanford Research Institute a decade later, in 1968, which concluded that the burning of fossil fuels would bring ''significant temperature changes'' by the year 2000 and ultimately ''serious worldwide environmental changes,'' including the melting of the Antarctic ice cap and rising seas. It was ''ironic,'' the study's authors noted, that politicians, regulators and environmentalists fixated on local incidents of air pollution that were immediately observable, while the climate crisis, whose damage would be of far greater severity and scale, went entirely unheeded.The ritual repeated itself every few years. Industry scientists, at the behest of their corporate bosses, reviewed the problem and found good reasons for alarm and better excuses to do nothing. Why should they act when almost nobody within the United States government -- nor, for that matter, within the environmental movement -- seemed worried? Besides, as the National Petroleum Council put it in 1972, changes in the climate would probably not be apparent ''until at least the turn of the century.'' The industry had enough urgent crises: antitrust legislation introduced by Senator Ted Kennedy; concerns about the health effects of gasoline; battles over the Clean Air Act; and the financial shock of benzene regulation, which increased the cost of every gallon of gas sold in America. Why take on an intractable problem that would not be detected until this generation of employees was safely retired? Worse, the solutions seemed more punitive than the problem itself. Historically, energy use had correlated to economic growth -- the more fossil fuels we burned, the better our lives became. Why mess with that?But the Charney report had changed industry's cost-benefit calculus. Now there was a formal consensus about the nature of the crisis. As Henry Shaw emphasized in his conversations with Exxon's executives, the cost of inattention would rise in step with the Keeling curve.Wallace Broecker did not think much of one of Exxon's proposals for its new carbon-dioxide program: testing the corked air in vintage bottles of French wine to demonstrate how much carbon levels had increased over time. But he did help his colleague Taro Takahashi with a more ambitious experiment conducted onboard one of Exxon's largest supertankers, the Esso Atlantic, to determine how much carbon the oceans could absorb before coughing it back into the atmosphere. Unfortunately, the graduate student installed on the tanker botched the job, and the data came back a mess.Shaw was running out of time. In 1978, an Exxon colleague circulated an internal memo warning that humankind had only five to 10 years before policy action would be necessary. But Congress seemed ready to act a lot sooner than that. On April 3, 1980, Senator Paul Tsongas, a Massachusetts Democrat, held the first congressional hearing on carbon-dioxide buildup in the atmosphere. Gordon MacDonald testified that the United States should ''take the initiative'' and develop, through the United Nations, a way to coordinate every nation's energy policies to address the problem. That June, Jimmy Carter signed the Energy Security Act of 1980, which directed the National Academy of Sciences to start a multiyear, comprehensive study, to be called ''Changing Climate,'' that would analyze social and economic effects of climate change. More urgent, the National Commission on Air Quality, at the request of Congress, invited two dozen experts, including Henry Shaw himself, to a meeting in Florida to propose climate policy.It seemed that some kind of legislation to restrict carbon combustion was inevitable. The Charney report had confirmed the diagnosis of the problem -- a problem that Exxon helped create. Now Exxon would help shape the solution.5. 'We Are Flying Blind' October 1980Two days before Halloween, Rafe Pomerance traveled to a cotton-candy castle on the Gulf of Mexico, near St. Petersburg, Fla, that locals called the Pink Palace. The Don CeSar hotel was a child's daydream with cantilevered planes of bubble-gum stucco and vanilla-white cupolas that appeared to melt in the sunshine like scoops of ice cream. The hotel stood amid blooms of poisonwood and gumbo limbo on a narrow spit of porous limestone that rose no higher than five feet above the sea. In its carnival of historical amnesia and childlike faith in the power of fantasy, the Pink Palace was a fine setting for the first rehearsal of a conversation that would be earnestly restaged, with little variation and increasing desperation, for the next 40 years.In the year and a half since he had read the coal report, Pomerance had attended countless conferences and briefings about the science of global warming. But until now, nobody had shown much interest in the only subject that he cared about, the only subject that mattered -- how to prevent warming. In a sense, he had himself to thank: During the expansion of the Clean Air Act, he pushed for the creation of the National Commission on Air Quality, charged with ensuring that the goals of the act were being met. One such goal was a stable global climate. The Charney report had made clear that goal was not being met, and now the commission wanted to hear proposals for legislation. It was a profound responsibility, and the two dozen experts invited to the Pink Palace -- policy gurus, deep thinkers, an industry scientist and an environmental activist -- had only three days to achieve it, but the utopian setting made everything seem possible. The conference room looked better suited to hosting a wedding party than a bureaucratic meeting, its tall windows framing postcard views of the beach. The sands were blindingly white, the surf was idle, the air unseasonably hot and the dress code relaxed: sunglasses and guayaberas, jackets frowned upon.''I have a very vested interest in this,'' said State Representative Tom McPherson, a Florida Democrat, introducing himself to the delegation, ''because I own substantial holdings 15 miles inland of the coast, and any beachfront property appreciates in value.'' There was no formal agenda, just a young moderator from the E.P.A. named Thomas Jorling and a few handouts left on every seat, including a copy of the Charney report. Jorling acknowledged the vagueness of their mission.''We are flying blind, with little or no idea where the mountains are,'' he said. But the stakes couldn't be higher: A failure to recommend policy, he said, would be the same as endorsing the present policy -- which was no policy. He asked who wanted ''to break the ice,'' not quite appreciating the pun.''We might start out with an emotional question,'' proposed Thomas Waltz, an economist at the National Climate Program. ''The question is fundamental to being a human being: Do we care?''This provoked huffy consternation. ''In caring or not caring,'' said John Laurmann, a Stanford engineer, ''I would think the main thing is the timing.'' It was not an emotional question, in other words, but an economic one: How much did we value the future?We have less time than we realize, said an M.I.T. nuclear engineer named David Rose, who studied how civilizations responded to large technological crises. ''People leave their problems until the 11th hour, the 59th minute,'' he said. ''And then: 'Eloi, Eloi, Lama Sabachthani?' '' -- ''My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?'' It was a promising beginning, Pomerance thought. Urgent, detailed, cleareyed. The attendees seemed to share a sincere interest in finding solutions. They agreed that some kind of international treaty would ultimately be needed to keep atmospheric carbon dioxide at a safe level. But nobody could agree on what that level was.William Elliott, a NOAA scientist, introduced some hard facts: If the United States stopped burning carbon that year, it would delay the arrival of the doubling threshold by only five years. If Western nations somehow managed to stabilize emissions, it would forestall the inevitable by only eight years. The only way to avoid the worst was to stop burning coal. Yet China, the Soviet Union and the United States, by far the world's three largest coal producers, were frantically accelerating extraction.''Do we have a problem?'' asked Anthony Scoville, a congressional science consultant. ''We do, but it is not the atmospheric problem. It is the political problem.'' He doubted that any scientific report, no matter how ominous its predictions, would persuade politicians to act.Pomerance glanced out at the beach, where the occasional tourist dawdled in the surf. Beyond the conference room, few Americans realized that the planet would soon cease to resemble itself.What if the problem was that they were thinking of it as a problem? ''What I am saying,'' Scoville continued, ''is that in a sense we are making a transition not only in energy but the economy as a whole.'' Even if the coal and oil industries collapsed, renewable technologies like solar energy would take their place. Jimmy Carter was planning to invest $80 billion in synthetic fuel. ''My God,'' Scoville said, ''with $80 billion, you could have a photovoltaics industry going that would obviate the need for synfuels forever!''The talk of ending oil production stirred for the first time the gentleman from Exxon. ''I think there is a transition period,'' Henry Shaw said. ''We are not going to stop burning fossil fuels and start looking toward solar or nuclear fusion and so on. We are going to have a very orderly transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.''''We are talking about some major fights in this country,'' said Waltz, the economist. ''We had better be thinking this thing through.''But first -- lunch. It was a bright day, low 80s, and the group voted to break for three hours to enjoy the Florida sun. Pomerance couldn't -- he was restless. He had refrained from speaking, happy to let others lead the discussion, provided it moved in the right direction. But the high-minded talk had soon stalled into fecklessness and pusillanimity. He reflected that he was just about the only participant without an advanced degree. But few of these policy geniuses were showing much sense. They understood what was at stake, but they hadn't taken it to heart. They remained cool, detached -- pragmatists overmatched by a problem that had no pragmatic resolution. ''Prudence,'' Jorling said, ''is essential.''After lunch, Jorling tried to focus the conversation. What did they need to know in order to take action?David Slade, who as the director of the Energy Department's $200 million Office of Carbon Dioxide Effects had probably considered the question more deeply than anyone else in the room, said he figured that at some point, probably within their lifetimes, they would see the warming themselves.''And at that time,'' Pomerance bellowed, ''it will be too late to do anything about it.''Yet nobody could agree what to do. John Perry, a meteorologist who had worked as a staff member on the Charney report, suggested that American energy policy merely ''take into account'' the risks of global warming, though he acknowledged that a nonbinding measure might seem ''intolerably stodgy.''''It is so weak,'' Pomerance said, the air seeping out of him, ''as to not get us anywhere.''Reading the indecision in the room, Jorling reversed himself and wondered if it might be best to avoid proposing any specific policy. ''Let's not load ourselves down with that burden,'' he said. ''We'll let others worry.''Pomerance begged Jorling to reconsider. The commission had asked for hard proposals. But why stop there? Why not propose a new national energy plan? ''There is no single action that is going to solve the problem,'' Pomerance said. ''You can't keep saying, That isn't going to do it, and This isn't going to do it, because then we end up doing nothing.''Scoville pointed out that the United States was responsible for the largest share of global carbon emissions. But not for long. ''If we're going to exercise leadership,'' he said, ''the opportunity is now.'' One way to lead, he proposed, would be to classify carbon dioxide as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act and regulate it as such. This was received by the room like a belch. By Scoville's logic, every sigh was an act of pollution. Did the science really support such an extreme measure?The Charney report did exactly that, Pomerance said. He was beginning to lose his patience, his civility, his stamina. ''Now, if everybody wants to sit around and wait until the world warms up more than it has warmed up since there have been humans around -- fine. But I would like to have a shot at avoiding it.''Most everybody else seemed content to sit around. Some of the attendees confused uncertainty around the margins of the issue (whether warming would be three or four degrees Celsius in 50 or 75 years) for uncertainty about the severity of the problem. As Gordon MacDonald liked to say, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would rise; the only question was when. The lag between the emission of a gas and the warming it produced could be several decades. It was like adding an extra blanket on a mild night: It took a few minutes before you started to sweat.Yet Slade, the director of the Energy Department's carbon-dioxide program, considered the lag a saving grace. If changes did not occur for a decade or more, he said, those in the room couldn't be blamed for failing to prevent them. So what was the problem?''You're the problem,'' Pomerance said. Because of the lag between cause and effect, it was unlikely that humankind would detect hard evidence of warming until it was too late to reverse it. The lag would doom them. ''The U.S. has to do something to gain some credibility,'' he said.''So it is a moral stand,'' Slade replied, sensing an advantage.''Call it whatever.'' Besides, Pomerance added, they didn't have to ban coal tomorrow. A pair of modest steps could be taken immediately to show the world that the United States was serious: the implementation of a carbon tax and increased investment in renewable energy. Then the United States could organize an international summit meeting to address climate change. This was his closing plea to the group. The next day, they would have to draft policy proposals.But when the group reconvened after breakfast, they immediately became stuck on a sentence in their prefatory paragraph declaring that climatic changes were ''likely to occur.''''Will occur,'' proposed Laurmann, the Stanford engineer.''What about the words: highly likely to occur?'' Scoville asked.''Almost sure,'' said David Rose, the nuclear engineer from M.I.T.''Almost surely,'' another said.''Changes of an undetermined -- ''''Changes as yet of a little-understood nature?''''Highly or extremely likely to occur,'' Pomerance said.''Almost surely to occur?''''No,'' Pomerance said.''I would like to make one statement,'' said Annemarie Crocetti, a public-health scholar who sat on the National Commission on Air Quality and had barely spoken all week. ''I have noticed that very often when we as scientists are cautious in our statements, everybody else misses the point, because they don't understand our qualifications.''''As a nonscientist,'' said Tom McPherson, the Florida legislator, ''I really concur.''Yet these two dozen experts, who agreed on the major points and had made a commitment to Congress, could not draft a single paragraph. Hours passed in a hell of fruitless negotiation, self-defeating proposals and impulsive speechifying. Pomerance and Scoville pushed to include a statement calling for the United States to ''sharply accelerate international dialogue,'' but they were sunk by objections and caveats.''It is very emotional,'' Crocetti said, succumbing to her frustration. ''What we have asked is to get people from different disciplines to come together and tell us what you agree on and what your problems are. And you have only made vague statements -- ''She was interrupted by Waltz, the economist, who wanted simply to note that climate change would have profound effects. Crocetti waited until he exhausted himself, before resuming in a calm voice. ''All I am asking you to say is: 'We got ourselves a bunch of experts, and by God, they all endorse this point of view and think it is very important. They have disagreements about the details of this and that, but they feel that it behooves us to intervene at this point and try to prevent it.' ''They never got to policy proposals. They never got to the second paragraph. The final statement was signed by only the moderator, who phrased it more weakly than the declaration calling for the workshop in the first place. ''The guide I would suggest,'' Jorling wrote, ''is whether we know enough not to recommend changes in existing policy.''Pomerance had seen enough. A consensus-based strategy would not work -- could not work -- without American leadership. And the United States wouldn't act unless a strong leader persuaded it to do so -- someone who would speak with authority about the science, demand action from those in power and risk everything in pursuit of justice. Pomerance knew he wasn't that person: He was an organizer, a strategist, a fixer -- which meant he was an optimist and even, perhaps, a romantic. His job was to assemble a movement. And every movement, even one backed by widespread consensus, needed a hero. He just had to find one.6. 'Otherwise, They'll Gurgle' November 1980-September 1981The meeting ended Friday morning. On Tuesday, four days later, Ronald Reagan was elected president. And Rafe Pomerance soon found himself wondering whether what had seemed to have been a beginning had actually been the end.After the election, Reagan considered plans to close the Energy Department, increase coal production on federal land and deregulate surface coal mining. Once in office, he appointed James Watt, the president of a legal firm that fought to open public lands to mining and drilling, to run the Interior Department. ''We're deliriously happy,'' the president of the National Coal Association was reported to have said. Reagan preserved the E.P.A. but named as its administrator Anne Gorsuch, an anti-regulation zealot who proceeded to cut the agency's staff and budget by about a quarter. In the midst of this carnage, the Council on Environmental Quality submitted a report to the White House warning that fossil fuels could ''permanently and disastrously'' alter Earth's atmosphere, leading to ''a warming of the Earth, possibly with very serious effects.'' Reagan did not act on the council's advice. Instead, his administration considered eliminating the council.At the Pink Palace, Anthony Scoville had said that the problem was not atmospheric but political. That was only half right, Pomerance thought. For behind every political problem, there lay a publicity problem. And the climate crisis had a publicity nightmare. The Florida meeting had failed to prepare a coherent statement, let alone legislation, and now everything was going backward. Even Pomerance couldn't devote much time to climate change; Friends of the Earth was busier than ever. The campaigns to defeat the nominations of James Watt and Anne Gorsuch were just the beginning; there were also efforts to block mining in wilderness areas, maintain the Clean Air Act's standards for air pollutants and preserve funding for renewable energy (Reagan ''has declared open war on solar energy,'' the director of the nation's lead solar-energy research agency said, after he was asked to resign). Reagan appeared determined to reverse the environmental achievements of Jimmy Carter, before undoing those of Richard Nixon, Lyndon Johnson, John F. Kennedy and, if he could get away with it, Theodore Roosevelt.Reagan's violence to environmental regulations alarmed even members of his own party. Senator Robert Stafford, a Vermont Republican and chairman of the committee that held confirmation hearings on Gorsuch, took the unusual step of lecturing her from the dais about her moral obligation to protect the nation's air and water. Watt's plan to open the waters off California for oil drilling was denounced by the state's Republican senator, and Reagan's proposal to eliminate the position of science adviser was roundly derided by the scientists and engineers who advised him during his presidential campaign. When Reagan considered closing the Council on Environmental Quality, its acting chairman, Malcolm Forbes Baldwin, wrote to the vice president and the White House chief of staff begging them to reconsider; in a major speech the same week, ''A Conservative's Program for the Environment,'' Baldwin argued that it was ''time for today's conservatives explicitly to embrace environmentalism.'' Environmental protection was not only good sense. It was good business. What could be more conservative than an efficient use of resources that led to fewer federal subsidies?Meanwhile the Charney report continued to vibrate at the periphery of public consciousness. Its conclusions were confirmed by major studies from the Aspen Institute, the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis near Vienna and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Every month or so, nationally syndicated articles appeared summoning apocalypse: ''Another Warning on 'Greenhouse Effect,' '' ''Global Warming Trend 'Beyond Human Experience,' '' ''Warming Trend Could 'Pit Nation Against Nation.' '' People magazine had profiled Gordon MacDonald, photographing him standing on the steps of the Capitol and pointing above his head to the level the water would reach when the polar ice caps melted. ''If Gordon MacDonald is wrong, they'll laugh,'' the article read. ''Otherwise, they'll gurgle.''But Pomerance understood that in order to sustain major coverage, you needed major events. Studies were fine; speeches were good; news conferences were better. Hearings, however, were best. The ritual's theatrical trappings -- the members of Congress holding forth on the dais, their aides decorously passing notes, the witnesses sipping nervously from their water glasses, the audience transfixed in the gallery -- offered antagonists, dramatic tension, narrative. But you couldn't have a hearing without a scandal, or at least a scientific breakthrough. And two years after the Charney group met at Woods Hole, it seemed there was no more science to break through.It was with a shiver of optimism, then, that Pomerance read on the front page of The New York Times on Aug. 22, 1981, about a forthcoming paper in Science by a team of seven NASA scientists. They had found that the world had already warmed in the past century. Temperatures hadn't increased beyond the range of historical averages, but the scientists predicted that the warming signal would emerge from the noise of routine weather fluctuations much sooner than previously expected. Most unusual of all, the paper ended with a policy recommendation: In the coming decades, the authors wrote, humankind should develop alternative sources of energy and use fossil fuels only ''as necessary.'' The lead author was James Hansen.Pomerance called Hansen to ask for a meeting. He explained to Hansen that he wanted to make sure he understood the paper's conclusions. But more than that, he wanted to understand James Hansen.At the Goddard Institute, Pomerance entered Hansen's office, maneuvering through some 30 piles of documents arrayed across the floor like the skyscrapers of a model city, some as high as his waist. On top of many of the stacks lay a scrap of cardboard on which had been scrawled words like Trace Gases, Ocean, Jupiter, Venus. At the desk, Pomerance found, hidden behind another paper metropolis, a quiet, composed man with a heavy brow and implacable green eyes. Hansen's speech was soft, equable, deliberate to the point of halting. He would have no trouble passing for a small-town accountant, insurance-claims manager or actuary. In a sense he held all of those jobs, only his client was the global atmosphere. Pomerance's political sensitivities sparked. He liked what he saw.As Hansen spoke, Pomerance listened and watched. He understood Hansen's basic findings well enough: Earth had been warming since 1880, and the warming would reach ''almost unprecedented magnitude'' in the next century, leading to the familiar suite of terrors, including the flooding of a 10th of New Jersey and a quarter of Louisiana and Florida. But Pomerance was excited to find that Hansen could translate the complexities of atmospheric science into plain English. Though he was something of a wunderkind -- at 40, he was about to be named director of the Goddard Institute -- he spoke with the plain-spoken Midwestern forthrightness that played on Capitol Hill. He presented like a heartland voter, the kind of man interviewed on the evening news about the state of the American dream or photographed in the dying sun against a blurry agricultural landscape in a campaign ad. And unlike most scientists in the field, he was not afraid to follow his research to its policy implications. He was perfect.''What you have to say needs to be heard,'' Pomerance said. ''Are you willing to be a witness?''7. 'We're All Going to Be the Victims' March 1982Though few people other than Rafe Pomerance seemed to have noticed amid Reagan's environmental blitzkrieg, another hearing on the greenhouse effect was held several weeks earlier, on July 31, 1981. It was led by Representative James Scheuer, a New York Democrat -- who lived at sea level on the Rockaway Peninsula, in a neighborhood no more than four blocks wide, sandwiched between two beaches -- and a canny, 33-year-old congressman named Albert Gore Jr.Gore had learned about climate change a dozen years earlier as an undergraduate at Harvard, when he took a class taught by Roger Revelle. Humankind was on the brink of radically transforming the global atmosphere, Revelle explained, drawing Keeling's rising zigzag on the blackboard, and risked bringing about the collapse of civilization. Gore was stunned: Why wasn't anyone talking about this? He had no memory of hearing it from his father, a three-term senator from Tennessee who later served as chairman of an Ohio coal company. Once in office, Gore figured that if Revelle gave Congress the same lecture, his colleagues would be moved to act. Or at least that the hearing would get picked up by one of the three major national news broadcasts.Gore's hearing was part of a larger campaign he had designed with his staff director, Tom Grumbly. After winning his third term in 1980, Gore was granted his first leadership position, albeit a modest one: chairman of an oversight subcommittee within the Committee on Science and Technology -- a subcommittee that he had lobbied to create. Most in Congress considered the science committee a legislative backwater, if they considered it at all; this made Gore's subcommittee, which had no legislative authority, an afterthought to an afterthought. That, Gore vowed, would change. Environmental and health stories had all the elements of narrative drama: villains, victims and heroes. In a hearing, you could summon all three, with the chairman serving as narrator, chorus and moral authority. He told his staff director that he wanted to hold a hearing every week.It was like storyboarding episodes of a weekly procedural drama. Grumbly assembled a list of subjects that possessed the necessary dramatic elements: a Massachusetts cancer researcher who faked his results, the dangers of excessive salt in the American diet, the disappearance of an airplane on Long Island. All fit Gore's template; all had sizzle. But Gore wondered why Grumbly hadn't included the greenhouse effect.There are no villains, Grumbly said. Besides, who's your victim?If we don't do something, Gore replied, we're all going to be the victims.He didn't say: If we don't do something, we'll be the villains too.The Revelle hearing went as Grumbly had predicted. The urgency of the issue was lost on Gore's older colleagues, who drifted in and out while the witnesses testified. There were few people left by the time the Brookings Institution economist Lester Lave warned that humankind's profligate exploitation of fossil fuels posed an existential test to human nature. ''Carbon dioxide stands as a symbol now of our willingness to confront the future,'' he said. ''It will be a sad day when we decide that we just don't have the time or thoughtfulness to address those issues.'' That night, the news programs featured the resolution of the baseball strike, the ongoing budgetary debate and the national surplus of butter.But Gore soon found another opening. Congressional staff members on the science committee heard that the White House planned to eliminate the Energy Department's carbon-dioxide program. If they could put a hearing together quickly enough, they could shame the White House before it could go through with its plan. The Times article about Hansen's paper had proved that there was a national audience for the carbon-dioxide problem -- it just had to be framed correctly. Hansen could occupy the role of hero: a mild-mannered scientist who had seen the future and now sought to rouse the world to action. A villain was emerging, too: Fred Koomanoff, Reagan's new director of the Energy Department's carbon-dioxide program, a Bronx native with the manner of a sergeant major and an unconstrained passion for budget-cutting. Each man would testify.Hansen did not disclose to Gore's staff that, in late November, he received a letter from Koomanoff declining to fund his climate-modeling research despite a promise from Koomanoff's predecessor. Koomanoff left open the possibility of funding other carbon-dioxide research, but Hansen was not optimistic, and when his funding lapsed, he had to release five employees, half his staff. Koomanoff, it seemed, would not be moved. But the hearing would give Hansen the chance to appeal directly to the congressmen who oversaw Koomanoff's budget.Hansen flew to Washington to testify on March 25, 1982, performing before a gallery even more thinly populated than at Gore's first hearing on the greenhouse effect. Gore began by attacking the Reagan administration for cutting funding for carbon-dioxide research despite the ''broad consensus in the scientific community that the greenhouse effect is a reality.'' William Carney, a Republican from New York, bemoaned the burning of fossil fuels and argued passionately that science should serve as the basis for legislative policy. Bob Shamansky, a Democrat from Ohio, objected to the use of the term ''greenhouse effect'' for such a horrifying phenomenon, because he had always enjoyed visiting greenhouses. ''Everything,'' he said, ''seems to flourish in there.'' He suggested that they call it the ''microwave oven'' effect, ''because we are not flourishing too well under this; apparently, we are getting cooked.''There emerged, despite the general comity, a partisan divide. Unlike the Democrats, the Republicans demanded action. ''Today I have a sense of d쎩jÃ  vu,'' said Robert Walker, a Republican from Pennsylvania. In each of the last five years, he said, ''we have been told and told and told that there is a problem with the increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. We all accept that fact, and we realize that the potential consequences are certainly major in their impact on mankind.'' Yet they had failed to propose a single law. ''Now is the time,'' he said. ''The research is clear. It is up to us now to summon the political will.''Gore disagreed: A higher degree of certainty was required, he believed, in order to persuade a majority of Congress to restrict the use of fossil fuels. The reforms required were of such magnitude and sweep that they ''would challenge the political will of our civilization.''Yet the experts invited by Gore agreed with the Republicans: The science was certain enough. Melvin Calvin, a Berkeley chemist who won the Nobel Prize for his work on the carbon cycle, said that it was useless to wait for stronger evidence of warming. ''You cannot do a thing about it when the signals are so big that they come out of the noise,'' he said. ''You have to look for early warning signs.''Hansen's job was to share the warning signs, to translate the data into plain English. He explained a few discoveries that his team had made -- not with computer models but in libraries. By analyzing records from hundreds of weather stations, he found that the surface temperature of the planet had already increased four-tenths of a degree Celsius in the previous century. Data from several hundred tide-gauge stations showed that the oceans had risen four inches since the 1880s. Most disturbing of all, century-old glass astronomy plates had revealed a new problem: Some of the more obscure greenhouse gases -- especially chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, a class of man-made substances used in refrigerators and spray cans -- had proliferated wildly in recent years. ''We may already have in the pipeline a larger amount of climate change than people generally realize,'' Hansen told the nearly empty room.Gore asked when the planet would reach a point of no return -- a ''trigger point,'' after which temperatures would spike. ''I want to know,'' Gore said, ''whether I am going to face it or my kids are going to face it.''''Your kids are likely to face it,'' Calvin replied. ''I don't know whether you will or not. You look pretty young.''It occurred to Hansen that this was the only political question that mattered: How long until the worst began? It was not a question on which geophysicists expended much effort; the difference between five years and 50 years in the future was meaningless in geologic time. Politicians were capable of thinking only in terms of electoral time: six years, four years, two years. But when it came to the carbon problem, the two time schemes were converging.''Within 10 or 20 years,'' Hansen said, ''we will see climate changes which are clearly larger than the natural variability.''James Scheuer wanted to make sure he understood this correctly. No one else had predicted that the signal would emerge that quickly. ''If it were one or two degrees per century,'' he said, ''that would be within the range of human adaptability. But we are pushing beyond the range of human adaptability.''''Yes,'' Hansen said.How soon, Scheuer asked, would they have to change the national model of energy production?Hansen hesitated -- it wasn't a scientific question. But he couldn't help himself. He had been irritated, during the hearing, by all the ludicrous talk about the possibility of growing more trees to offset emissions. False hopes were worse than no hope at all: They undermined the prospect of developing real solutions.''That time is very soon,'' Hansen said finally.''My opinion is that it is past,'' Calvin said, but he was not heard because he spoke from his seat. He was told to speak into the microphone.''It is already later,'' Calvin said, ''than you think.''8. 'The Direction of an Impending Catastrophe' 1982From Gore's perspective, the hearing was an unequivocal success. That night Dan Rather devoted three minutes of ''CBS Evening News'' to the greenhouse effect. A correspondent explained that temperatures had increased over the previous century, great sheets of pack ice in Antarctica were rapidly melting, the seas were rising; Calvin said that ''the trend is all in the direction of an impending catastrophe''; and Gore mocked Reagan for his shortsightedness. Later, Gore could take credit for protecting the Energy Department's carbon-dioxide program, which in the end was largely preserved.But Hansen did not get new funding for his carbon-dioxide research. He wondered whether he had been doomed by his testimony or by his conclusion, in the Science paper, that full exploitation of coal resources -- a stated goal of Reagan's energy policy -- was ''undesirable.'' Whatever the cause, he found himself alone. He knew he had done nothing wrong -- he had only done diligent research and reported his findings, first to his peers, then to the American people. But now it seemed as if he was being punished for it.Anniek could read his disappointment, but she was not entirely displeased. Jim cut down on his work hours, leaving the Goddard Institute at 5 o'clock each day, which allowed him to coach his children's basketball and baseball teams. (He was a patient, committed coach, detail-oriented, if a touch too competitive for his wife's liking.) At home, Jim spoke only about the teams and their fortunes, keeping to himself his musings -- whether he would be able to secure federal funding for his climate experiments, whether the institute would be forced to move its office to Maryland to cut costs.But perhaps there were other ways forward. Not long after Hansen laid off five of his assistants, a major symposium he was helping to organize received overtures from a funding partner far wealthier and less ideologically blinkered than the Reagan administration: Exxon. Following Henry Shaw's recommendation to establish credibility ahead of any future legislative battles, Exxon had begun to spend conspicuously on global-warming research. It donated tens of thousands of dollars to some of the most prominent research efforts, including one at Woods Hole led by the ecologist George Woodwell, who had been calling for major climate policy as early as the mid-1970s, and an international effort coordinated by the United Nations. Now Shaw offered to fund the October 1982 symposium on climate change at Columbia's Lamont-Doherty campus.As an indication of the seriousness with which Exxon took the issue, Shaw sent Edward David Jr., the president of the research division and the former science adviser to Nixon. Hansen was glad for the support. He figured that Exxon's contributions might go well beyond picking up the bill for travel expenses, lodging and a dinner for dozens of scientists at the colonial-style Clinton Inn in Tenafly, N.J. As a gesture of appreciation, David was invited to give the keynote address.There were moments in David's speech in which he seemed to channel Rafe Pomerance. David boasted that Exxon would usher in a new global energy system to save the planet from the ravages of climate change. He went so far as to argue that capitalism's blind faith in the wisdom of the free market was ''less than satisfying'' when it came to the greenhouse effect. Ethical considerations were necessary, too. He pledged that Exxon would revise its corporate strategy to account for climate change, even if it were not ''fashionable'' to do so. As Exxon had already made heavy investments in nuclear and solar technology, he was ''generally upbeat'' that Exxon would ''invent'' a future of renewable energy.Hansen had reason to feel upbeat himself. If the world's largest oil-and-gas company supported a new national energy model, the White House would not stand in its way. The Reagan administration was hostile to change from within its ranks. But it couldn't be hostile to Exxon.It seemed that something was beginning to turn. With the carbon-dioxide problem as with other environmental crises, the Reagan administration had alienated many of its own supporters. The early demonstrations of autocratic force had retreated into compromise and deference. By the end of 1982, multiple congressional committees were investigating Anne Gorsuch for her indifference to enforcing the cleanup of Superfund sites, and the House voted to hold her in contempt of Congress; Republicans in Congress turned on James Watt after he eliminated thousands of acres of land from consideration for wilderness designation. Each cabinet member would resign within a year.The carbon-dioxide issue was beginning to receive major national attention -- Hansen's own findings had become front-page news, after all. What started as a scientific story was turning into a political story. This prospect would have alarmed Hansen several years earlier; it still made him uneasy. But he was beginning to understand that politics offered freedoms that the rigors of the scientific ethic denied. The political realm was itself a kind of Mirror World, a parallel reality that crudely mimicked our own. It shared many of our most fundamental laws, like the laws of gravity and inertia and publicity. And if you applied enough pressure, the Mirror World of politics could be sped forward to reveal a new future. Hansen was beginning to understand that too.Part Two 1983--19891. 'Caution, Not Panic' 1983-1984From a stray comment in an obscure coal report to portentous front-page headlines in the national press and hearings on Capitol Hill -- in just three years, Rafe Pomerance had watched as an issue considered esoteric even within the scientific community rose nearly to the level of action, the level at which congressmen made statements like, ''It is up to us now to summon the political will.'' Then, overnight, it died. Pomerance knew, from tired experience, that politics didn't move in a straight line, but jaggedly, like the Keeling curve -- a slow progression interrupted by sharp seasonal declines. But in the fall of 1983, the climate issue entered an especially long, dark winter. And all because of a single report that had done nothing to change the state of climate science but transformed the state of climate politics.After the publication of the Charney report in 1979, Jimmy Carter had directed the National Academy of Sciences to prepare a comprehensive, $1 million analysis of the carbon-dioxide problem: a Warren Commission for the greenhouse effect. A team of scientist-dignitaries -- among them Revelle, the Princeton modeler Syukuro Manabe and the Harvard political economist Thomas Schelling, one of the intellectual architects of Cold War game theory -- would review the literature, evaluate the consequences of global warming for the world order and propose remedies. Then Reagan won the White House.For the next three years, as the commission continued its work -- drawing upon the help of about 70 experts from the fields of atmospheric chemistry, economics and political science, including veterans of the Charney group and the Manhattan Project -- the incipient report served as the Reagan administration's answer to every question on the subject. There could be no climate policy, Fred Koomanoff and his associates said, until the academy ruled. In the Mirror World of the Reagan administration, the warming problem hadn't been abandoned at all. A careful, comprehensive solution was being devised. Everyone just had to wait for the academy's elders to explain what it was.On Oct. 19, 1983, the commission finally announced its findings at a formal gala, preceded by cocktails and dinner in the academy's cruciform Great Hall, a secular Sistine Chapel, with vaulted ceilings soaring to a dome painted as the sun. An inscription encircling the sun honored science as the ''pilot of industry,'' and the academy had invited the nation's foremost pilots of industry: Andrew Callegari, the head of Exxon's carbon-dioxide research program, and vice presidents from Peabody Coal, General Motors and the Synthetic Fuels Corporation. They were eager to learn how the United States planned to act, so they could prepare for the inevitable policy debates. Rafe Pomerance was eager, too. But he wasn't invited.He did manage, however, to get into a crowded press briefing earlier that day, where he grabbed a copy of the 500-page report, ''Changing Climate,'' and scanned its contents. Its scope was impressive: It was the first study to encompass the causes, effects and geopolitical consequences of climate change. But as he flipped through, Pomerance surmised that it offered no significant new findings -- nothing that wasn't in the Charney report or the blue-ribbon studies that had been published since. ''We are deeply concerned about environmental changes of this magnitude,'' read the executive summary. ''We may get into trouble in ways that we have barely imagined.''The authors did try to imagine some of them: an ice-free Arctic, for instance, and Boston sinking into its harbor, Beacon Hill an island two miles off the coast. There was speculation about political revolution, trade wars and a long quotation from ''A Distant Mirror,'' a medieval history written by Pomerance's aunt, Barbara Tuchman, describing how climate changes in the 14th century led to ''people eating their own children'' and ''feeding on hanged bodies taken down from the gibbet.'' The committee's chairman, William Nierenberg -- a Jason, presidential adviser and director of Scripps, the nation's pre-eminent oceanographic institution -- argued that action had to be taken immediately, before all the details could be known with certainty, or else it would be too late.That's what Nierenberg wrote in ''Changing Climate.'' But it's not what he said in the press interviews that followed. He argued the opposite: There was no urgent need for action. The public should not entertain the most ''extreme negative speculations'' about climate change (despite the fact that many of those speculations appeared in his report). Though ''Changing Climate'' urged an accelerated transition to renewable fuels, noting that it would take thousands of years for the atmosphere to recover from the damage of the last century, Nierenberg recommended ''caution, not panic.'' Better to wait and see. Better to bet on American ingenuity to save the day. Major interventions in national energy policy, taken immediately, might end up being more expensive, and less effective, than actions taken decades in the future, after more was understood about the economic and social consequences of a warmer planet. Yes, the climate would change, mostly for the worst, but future generations would be better equipped to change with it.As Pomerance listened at the briefing to the commission's appeasements, he glanced, baffled, around the room. The reporters and staff members listened politely to the presentation and took dutiful notes, as at any technical briefing. Government officials who knew Nierenberg were not surprised by his conclusions: He was an optimist by training and experience, a devout believer in the doctrine of American exceptionalism, one of the elite class of scientists who had helped the nation win a global war, invent the most deadly weapon conceivable and create the booming aerospace and computer industries. America had solved every existential problem it had confronted over the previous generation; it would not be daunted by an excess of carbon dioxide. Nierenberg had also served on Reagan's transition team. Nobody believed that he had been directly influenced by his political connections, but his views -- optimistic about the saving graces of market forces, pessimistic about the value of government regulation -- reflected all the ardor of his party.Pomerance, who came of age during the Vietnam War and the birth of the environmental movement, shared none of Nierenberg's Procrustean faith in American ingenuity. He worried about the dark undertow of industrial advancement, the way every new technological superpower carried within it unintended consequences that, if unchecked over time, eroded the foundations of society. New technologies had not solved the clean-air and clean-water crises of the 1970s. Activism and organization, leading to robust government regulation, had. Listening to the commission's equivocations, Pomerance shook his head, rolled his eyes, groaned. He felt that he was the only sane person in a briefing room gone mad. It was wrong. A colleague told him to calm down.The damage of ''Changing Climate'' was squared by the amount of attention it received. Nierenberg's speech in the Great Hall, being one-500th the length of the actual assessment, received 500 times the press coverage. As The Wall Street Journal put it, in a line echoed by trade journals across the nation: ''A panel of top scientists has some advice for people worried about the much-publicized warming of the Earth's climate: You can cope.'' The effusiveness of Nierenberg's reassurances invited derision. On ''CBS Evening News,'' Dan Rather said the academy had given ''a cold shoulder'' to a grim, 200-page E.P.A. assessment published earlier that week (titled ''Can We Delay a Greenhouse Warming?''; the E.P.A.'s answer, reduced to a word, was no). The Washington Post described the two reports, taken together, as ''clarion calls to inaction.''On its front page, The New York Times published its most prominent piece on global warming to date, under the headline ''Haste on Global Warming Trend Is Opposed.'' Although the paper included an excerpt from ''Changing Climate'' that detailed some of the report's gloomier predictions, the article itself gave the greatest weight to a statement, heavily workshopped by the White House's senior staff, from George Keyworth II, Reagan's science adviser. Keyworth used Nierenberg's optimism as reason to discount the E.P.A.'s ''unwarranted and unnecessarily alarmist'' report and warned against taking any ''near-term corrective action'' on global warming. Just in case it wasn't clear, Keyworth added, ''there are no actions recommended other than continued research.''Exxon soon revised its position on climate-change research. In a presentation at an industry conference, Henry Shaw cited ''Changing Climate'' as evidence that ''the general consensus is that society has sufficient time to technologically adapt to a COâ‚‚ greenhouse effect.'' If the academy had concluded that regulations were not a serious option, why should Exxon protest? Edward David Jr., two years removed from boasting of Exxon's commitment to transforming global energy policy, told Science that the corporation had reconsidered. ''Exxon has reverted to being mainly a supplier of conventional hydrocarbon fuels -- petroleum products, natural gas and steam coal,'' David said. The American Petroleum Institute canceled its own carbon-dioxide research program, too.A few months after the publication of ''Changing Climate,'' Pomerance announced his resignation from Friends of the Earth. He had various reasons: He had struggled with the politics of managing a staff and a board, and the environmental movement from which the organization had emerged in the early '70s was in crisis. It lacked a unifying cause. Climate change, Pomerance believed, could be that cause. But its insubstantiality made it difficult to rally the older activists, whose strategic model relied on protests at sites of horrific degradation -- Love Canal, Hetch Hetchy, Three Mile Island. How did you protest when the toxic waste dump was the entire planet or, worse, its invisible atmosphere?Observing her husband, Lenore Pomerance was reminded of an old Philadelphia Bulletin ad campaign: ''In Philadelphia -- nearly everyone reads The Bulletin.'' On a crowded beach, all the sunbathers have their faces buried in their newspapers, except for one man, who stares off into the distance. Here the scenario was reversed: Rafe, the loner, was staring down the world's largest problem while everyone else was distracted by the minutiae of daily life. Pomerance acted cheerful at home, fooling his kids. But he couldn't fool Lenore. She worried about his health. Near the end of his tenure at Friends of the Earth, a doctor found that he had an abnormally high heart rate.Pomerance planned to take a couple of months to reflect on what he wanted to do with the rest of his life. Two months stretched to about a year. He brooded; he checked out. He spent weeks at a time at an old farmhouse that he and Lenore owned in West Virginia, near Seneca Rocks. When they bought it in the early '70s, the house had a wood-burning stove and no running water. To make a phone call on a private line, you had drive to the operator's house and hope she was in. Pomerance sat in the cold house and thought.The winter took him back to his childhood in Greenwich. He had a vivid memory of being taught by his mother to ice skate on a frozen pond a short walk from their home. He remembered the muffled hush of twilight, the snow dusting the ice, the ghostly clearing encircled by a wood darker than the night. Their house was designed by his father, an architect whose glass-enveloped buildings mocked the vanity of humankind's efforts to improve on nature; the windows invited the elements inside, the trees and the ice and, in the rattling of the broad panes, the wind. Winter, Pomerance believed, was part of his soul. When he thought about the future, he worried about the loss of ice, the loss of the spiky Connecticut January mornings. He worried about the loss of some irreplaceable part of himself.He wanted to recommit himself to the fight but couldn't figure out how. If science, industry and the press could not move the government to act, then who could? He didn't see what was left for him, or anyone else, to do. He didn't see that the answer was at that moment floating over his head, about 10 miles above his West Virginian farmhouse, just above the highest clouds in the sky.2. 'You Scientists Win' 1985It was as if, without warning, the sky opened and the sun burst through in all its irradiating, blinding fury. The mental image was of a pin stuck through a balloon, a chink in an eggshell, a crack in the ceiling -- Armageddon descending from above. It was a sudden global emergency: There was a hole in the ozone layer.The klaxon was rung by a team of British government scientists, until then little known in the field, who made regular visits to research stations in Antarctica -- one on the Argentine Islands, the other on a sheet of ice floating into the sea at the rate of a quarter mile per year. At each site, the scientists had set up a machine invented in the 1920s called the Dobson spectrophotometer, which resembled a large slide projector turned with its eye staring straight up. After several years of results so alarming that they disbelieved their own evidence, the British scientists at last reported their discovery in an article published in May 1985 by Nature. ''The spring values of total Oâ‚ƒ in Antarctica have now fallen considerably,'' the abstract read. But by the time the news filtered into national headlines and television broadcasts several months later, it had transfigured into something far more terrifying: a substantial increase in skin cancer, a sharp decline in the global agricultural yield and the mass death of fish larva, near the base of the marine food chain. Later came fears of atrophied immune systems and blindness.The urgency of the alarm seemed to have everything to do with the phrase ''a hole in the ozone layer,'' which, charitably put, was a mixed metaphor. For there was no hole, and there was no layer. Ozone, which shielded Earth from ultraviolet radiation, was distributed throughout the atmosphere, settling mostly in the middle stratosphere and never in a concentration higher than 15 parts per million. As for the ''hole'' -- while the amount of ozone over Antarctica had declined drastically, the depletion was a temporary phenomenon, lasting about two months a year. In satellite images colorized to show ozone density, however, the darker region appeared to depict a void. When F.Sherwood Rowland, one of the chemists who identified the problem in 1974, spoke of the ''ozone hole'' in a university slide lecture in November 1985, the crisis found its catchphrase. The New York Times used it that same day in its article about the British team's findings, and while scientific journals initially refused to use the term, within a year it was unavoidable. The ozone crisis had its signal, which was also a symbol: a hole.It was already understood, thanks to the work of Rowland and his colleague Mario Molina, that the damage was largely caused by the man-made CFCs used in refrigerators, spray bottles and plastic foams, which escaped into the stratosphere and devoured ozone molecules. It was also understood that the ozone problem and the greenhouse-gas problem were linked. CFCs were unusually potent greenhouse gases. Though CFCs had been mass-produced only since the 1930s, they were already responsible, by Jim Hansen's calculation, for nearly half of Earth's warming during the 1970s. But nobody was worried about CFCs because of their warming potential. They were worried about getting skin cancer.The United Nations, through two of its intergovernmental agencies -- the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization -- had in 1977 established a World Plan of Action on the Ozone Layer. In 1985, UNEP adopted a framework for a global treaty, the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer. The negotiators failed to agree upon any specific CFC regulations in Vienna, but after the British scientists reported their findings from the Antarctic two months later, the Reagan administration proposed a reduction in CFC emissions of 95 percent. The speed of the reversal was all the more remarkable because CFC regulation faced virulent opposition. Dozens of American businesses with the word ''refrigeration'' in their names, together with hundreds involved in the production, manufacture and consumption of chemicals, plastics, paper goods and frozen food -- around 500 companies in total, from DuPont and the American Petroleum Institute to Mrs. Smith's Frozen Food Company of Pottstown, Pa. -- had united in 1980 as the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy. The alliance hounded the E.P.A., members of Congress and Reagan himself, insisting that ozone science was uncertain. The few concessions the alliance won, like forcing the E.P.A. to withdraw a plan to regulate CFCs, were swiftly overturned by lawsuits, and once the public discovered the ''ozone hole,'' every relevant government agency and every sitting United States senator urged the president to endorse the United Nations' plans for a treaty. When Reagan finally submitted the Vienna Convention to the Senate for ratification, he praised the ''leading role'' played by the United States, fooling nobody.Senior members of the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization, including Bert Bolin, a veteran of the Charney group, began to wonder whether they could do for the carbon-dioxide problem what they had done for ozone policy. The organizations had been holding semiannual conferences on global warming since the early 1970s. But in 1985, just several months after the bad news from the Antarctic, at an otherwise sleepy meeting in Villach, Austria, the assembled 89 scientists from 29 countries began to discuss a subject that fell wildly outside their discipline: politics.An Irish hydrology expert asked if his country should reconsider the location of its dams. A Dutch seacoast engineer questioned the wisdom of rebuilding dikes that had been destroyed by recent floods. And the conference's chairman, James Bruce, an unassuming, pragmatic hydrometeorologist from Ontario, posed a question that shocked his audience.Bruce was a minister of the Canadian environmental agency, a position that conferred him the esteem that his American counterparts had forfeited when Reagan won the White House. Just before leaving for Villach, he met with provincial dam and hydropower managers. O.K., one of them said, you scientists win. You've convinced me that the climate is changing. Well, tell me how it's changing. In 20 years, will the rain be falling somewhere else?Bruce took this challenge to Villach: You're the experts. What am I supposed to tell him? People are hearing the message, and they want to hear more. So how do we, in the scientific world, begin a dialogue with the world of action?The world of action. For a room of scientists who prided themselves as belonging to a specialized guild of monkish austerity, this was a startling provocation. On a bus tour of the countryside, commissioned by their Austrian hosts, Bruce sat with Roger Revelle, ignoring the Alps, speaking animatedly about the need for scientists to demand political remedies in times of existential crisis.The formal report ratified at Villach contained the most forceful warnings yet issued by a scientific body. Most major economic decisions undertaken by nations, it pointed out, were based on the assumption that past climate conditions were a reliable guide to the future. But the future would not look like the past. Though some warming was inevitable, the scientists wrote, the extent of the disaster could be ''profoundly affected'' by aggressive, coordinated government policies. Fortunately there was a new model in place to achieve just that. The balloon could be patched, the eggshell bandaged, the ceiling replastered. There was still time.3. The Size of The Human Imagination Spring-Summer 1986It was the spring of 1986, and Curtis Moore, a Republican staff member on the Committee on Environment and Public Works, was telling Rafe Pomerance that the greenhouse effect wasn't a problem.With his last ounce of patience, Pomerance begged to disagree.Yes, Moore clarified -- of course, it was an existential problem, the fate of the civilization depended on it, the oceans would boil, all of that. But it wasn't a political problem. Know how you could tell? Political problems had solutions. And the climate issue had none. Without a solution -- an obvious, attainable one -- any policy could only fail. No elected politician desired to come within shouting distance of failure. So when it came to the dangers of despoiling our planet beyond the range of habitability, most politicians didn't see a problem. Which meant that Pomerance had a very big problem indeed.He had followed the rapid ascension of the ozone issue with the rueful admiration of a competitor. He was thrilled for its success -- however inadvertently, the treaty would serve as the world's first action to delay climate change. But it offered an especially acute challenge for Pomerance, who after his yearlong hiatus had become, as far as he knew, the nation's first, and only, full-time global-warming lobbyist. At the suggestion of Gordon MacDonald, Pomerance joined the World Resources Institute, a nonprofit begun by Gus Speth, a senior environmental official in Jimmy Carter's White House and a founder of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Unlike Friends of the Earth, W.R.I. was not an activist organization; it occupied the nebulous intersection of politics, international relations and energy policy. Its mission was expansive enough to allow Pomerance to work without interference. Yet the only thing that anyone on Capitol Hill wanted to talk about was ozone.That was Curtis Moore's proposal: Use ozone to revive climate. The ozone hole had a solution -- an international treaty, already in negotiation. Why not hitch the milk wagon to the bullet train? Pomerance was skeptical. The problems were related, sure: Without a reduction in CFC emissions, you didn't have a chance of averting cataclysmic global warming. But it had been difficult enough to explain the carbon issue to politicians and journalists; why complicate the sales pitch? Then again, he didn't see what choice he had. The Republicans controlled the Senate, and Moore was his connection to the Senate's environmental committee.Moore came through. At his suggestion, Pomerance met with Senator John Chafee, a Republican from Rhode Island, and helped persuade him to hold a double-barreled hearing on the twin problems of ozone and carbon dioxide on June 10 and 11, 1986. F.Sherwood Rowland, Robert Watson, a NASA scientist, and Richard Benedick, the administration's lead representative in international ozone negotiations, would discuss ozone; James Hansen, Al Gore, the ecologist George Woodwell and Carl Wunsch, a veteran of the Charney group, would testify about climate change. As soon as the first witness appeared, Pomerance realized that Moore's instincts had been right. The ozone gang was good.Robert Watson dimmed the lights in the hearing room. On a flimsy screen, he projected footage with the staticky, low-budget quality of a slasher flick. It showed a bird's-eye view of the Antarctic, partly obscured by spiraling clouds. The footage was so convincing that Chafee had to ask whether it was an actual satellite image. Watson acknowledged that though created by satellite data, it was, in fact, a simulation. An animation, to be precise. The three-minute video showed every day of October -- the month during which the ozone thinned most drastically -- for seven consecutive years. (The other months, conveniently, were omitted.) A canny filmmaker had colored the ''ozone hole'' pink. As the years sped forward, the polar vortex madly gyroscoping, the hole expanded until it obscured most of Antarctica. The smudge turned mauve, representing an even thinner density of ozone, and then the dark purple of a hemorrhaging wound. The data represented in the video wasn't new, but nobody had thought to represent it in this medium. If F.Sherwood Rowland's earlier colorized images were crime-scene photographs, Watson's video was a surveillance camera catching the killer red-handed.As Pomerance had hoped, fear about the ozone layer ensured a bounty of press coverage for the climate-change testimony. But as he had feared, it caused many people to conflate the two crises. One was Peter Jennings, who aired the video on ABC's ''World News Tonight,'' warning that the ozone hole ''could lead to flooding all over the world, also to drought and to famine.''The confusion helped: For the first time since the ''Changing Climate'' report, global-warming headlines appeared by the dozen. William Nierenberg's ''caution, not panic'' line was inverted. It was all panic without a hint of caution: ''A Dire Forecast for 'Greenhouse' Earth'' (the front page of The Washington Post); ''Scientists Predict Catastrophes in Growing Global Heat Wave'' (Chicago Tribune); ''Swifter Warming of Globe Foreseen'' (The New York Times). On the second day of the Senate hearing, devoted to global warming, every seat in the gallery was occupied; four men squeezed together on a broad window sill.Pomerance had suggested that Chafee, instead of opening with the typical statement about the need for more research, deliver a call for action. But Chafee went further: He called for the State Department to begin negotiations on an international solution with the Soviet Union. It was the kind of proposal that would have been unthinkable even a year earlier, but the ozone issue had established a precedent for global environmental problems: high-level meetings among the world's most powerful nations, followed by a global summit meeting to negotiate a framework for a treaty to restrict emissions.After three years of backsliding and silence, Pomerance was exhilarated to see interest in the issue spike overnight. Not only that: A solution materialized, and a moral argument was passionately articulated -- by Rhode Island's Republican senator no less. ''Ozone depletion and the greenhouse effect can no longer be treated solely as important scientific questions,'' Chafee said. ''They must be seen as critical problems facing the nations of the world, and they are problems that demand solutions.''The old canard about the need for more research was roundly mocked -- by Woodwell, by a W.R.I. colleague named Andrew Maguire, by Senator George Mitchell, a Democrat from Maine. ''Scientists are never 100 percent certain,'' the Princeton historian Theodore Rabb testified. ''That notion of total certainty is something too elusive ever to be sought.'' As Pomerance had been saying since 1979, it was past time to act. Only now the argument was so broadly accepted that nobody dared object.The ozone hole, Pomerance realized, had moved the public because, though it was no more visible than global warming, people could be made to see it. They could watch it grow on video. Its metaphors were emotionally wrought: Instead of summoning a glass building that sheltered plants from chilly weather (''Everything seems to flourish in there''), the hole evoked a violent rending of the firmament, inviting deathly radiation. Americans felt that their lives were in danger. An abstract, atmospheric problem had been reduced to the size of the human imagination. It had been made just small enough, and just large enough, to break through.4. 'Atmospheric Scientist, New York, N.Y.' Fall 1987-Spring 1988Four years after ''Changing Climate,'' two years after a hole had torn open the firmament and a month after the United States and more than three dozen other nations signed a treaty to limit use of CFCs, the climate-change corps was ready to celebrate. It had become conventional wisdom that climate change would follow ozone's trajectory. Reagan's E.P.A. administrator, Lee M. Thomas, said as much the day he signed the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone Layer (the successor to the Vienna Convention), telling reporters that global warming was likely to be the subject of a future international agreement. Congress had already begun to consider policy -- in 1987 alone, there were eight days of climate hearings, in three committees, across both chambers of Congress; Senator Joe Biden, a Delaware Democrat, had introduced legislation to establish a national climate-change strategy. And so it was that Jim Hansen found himself on Oct. 27 in the not especially distinguished ballroom of the Quality Inn on New Jersey Avenue, a block from the Capitol, at ''Preparing for Climate Change,'' which was technically a conference but felt more like a wedding.The convivial mood had something to do with its host. John Topping was an old-line Rockefeller Republican, a Commerce Department lawyer under Nixon and an E.P.A. official under Reagan. He first heard about the climate problem in the halls of the E.P.A. in 1982 and sought out Hansen, who gave him a personal tutorial. Topping was amazed to discover that out of the E.P.A.'s 13,000-person staff, only seven people, by his count, were assigned to work on climate, though he figured it was more important to the long-term security of the nation than every other environmental issue combined. After leaving the administration, he founded a nonprofit organization, the Climate Institute, to bring together scientists, politicians and businesspeople to discuss policy solutions. He didn't have any difficulty raising $150,000 to hold ''Preparing for Climate Change''; the major sponsors included BP America, General Electric and the American Gas Association. Topping's industry friends were intrigued. If a guy like Topping thought this greenhouse business was important, they'd better see what it was all about.Glancing around the room, Jim Hansen could chart, like an arborist counting rings on a stump, the growth of the climate issue over the decade. Veterans like Gordon MacDonald, George Woodwell and the environmental biologist Stephen Schneider stood at the center of things. Former and current staff members from the congressional science committees (Tom Grumbly, Curtis Moore, Anthony Scoville) made introductions to the congressmen they advised. Hansen's owlish nemesis Fred Koomanoff was present, as were his counterparts from the Soviet Union and Western Europe. Rafe Pomerance's cranium could be seen above the crowd, but unusually he was surrounded by colleagues from other environmental organizations that until now had shown little interest in a diffuse problem with no proven fund-raising record. The party's most conspicuous newcomers, however, the outermost ring, were the oil-and-gas executives.It was not entirely surprising to see envoys from Exxon, the Gas Research Institute and the electrical-grid trade groups, even if they had been silent since ''Changing Climate.'' But they were joined by executives from General Electric, AT&T and the American Petroleum Institute, which that spring had invited a leading government scientist to make the case for a transition to renewable energy at the industry's annual world conference in Houston. Even Richard Barnett was there, the chairman of the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy, the face of the campaign to defeat an ozone treaty. Barnett's retreat had been humiliating and swift: After DuPont, by far the world's single largest manufacturer of CFCs, realized that it stood to profit from the transition to replacement chemicals, the alliance abruptly reversed its position, demanding that the United States sign a treaty as soon as possible. Now Barnett, at the Quality Inn, was speaking about how ''we bask in the glory of the Montreal Protocol'' and quoting Robert Frost's ''The Road Not Taken'' to express his hope for a renewed alliance between industry and environmentalists. There were more than 250 people in all in the old ballroom, and if the concentric rings extended any further, you would have needed a larger hotel.That evening, as a storm spat and coughed outside, Rafe Pomerance gave one of his exhortative speeches urging cooperation among the various factions, and John Chafee and Roger Revelle received awards; introductions were made and business cards earnestly exchanged. Not even a presentation by Hansen of his research could sour the mood. The next night, on Oct. 28, at a high-spirited dinner party in Topping's townhouse on Capitol Hill, the oil-and-gas men joked with the environmentalists, the trade-group representatives chatted up the regulators and the academics got merrily drunk. Mikhail Budyko, the don of the Soviet climatologists, settled into an extended conversation about global warming with Topping's 10-year-old son. It all seemed like the start of a grand bargain, a uniting of factions -- a solution.It was perhaps because of all this good cheer that it was Hansen's instinct to shrug off a peculiar series of events that took place just a week later. He was scheduled to appear before another Senate hearing, this time devoted entirely to climate change. It was called by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources after Rafe Pomerance and Gordon MacDonald persuaded its chairman, Bennett Johnston, a Democrat from Louisiana, of the issue's significance for the future of the oil-and-gas industry (Louisiana ranked third among states in oil production). Hansen was accustomed to the bureaucratic nuisances that attended testifying before Congress; before a hearing, he had to send his formal statement to NASA headquarters, which forwarded it to the White House's Office of Management and Budget for approval. ''Major greenhouse climate changes are a certainty,'' he had written. ''By the 2010s [in every scenario], essentially the entire globe has very substantial warming.''The process appeared entirely perfunctory, but this time, on the Friday evening before his appearance that Monday, he was informed that the White House demanded changes to his testimony. No rationale was provided. Nor did Hansen understand by what authority it could censor scientific findings. He told the administrator in NASA's legislative-affairs office that he refused to make the changes. If that meant he couldn't testify, so be it.The NASA administrator had another idea. The Office of Management and Budget had the authority to approve government witnesses, she explained. But it couldn't censor a private citizen.At the hearing three days later, on Monday, Nov. 9, Hansen was listed as ''Atmospheric Scientist, New York, N.Y. '' -- as if he were a crank with a telescope who had stumbled into the Senate off the street. He was careful to emphasize the absurdity of the situation in his opening remarks, at least to the degree that his Midwestern reserve would allow: ''Before I begin, I would like to state that although I direct the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, I am appearing here as a private citizen.'' In the most understated terms available to him, Hansen provided his credentials: ''Ten years' experience in terrestrial climate studies and more than 10 years' experience in the exploration and study of other planetary atmospheres.''Assuming that one of the senators would immediately ask about this odd introduction, Hansen had prepared an elegant response. He planned to say that although his NASA colleagues endorsed his findings, the White House had insisted he utter false statements that would have distorted his conclusions. He figured this would lead to an uproar. But no senator thought to ask about his title. So the atmospheric scientist from New York City said nothing else about it.After the hearing, he went to lunch with John Topping, who was stunned to hear of the White House's ham-handed attempt to silence him. ''Uh, oh,'' Topping joked, ''Jim is a dangerous man. We're going to have to rally the troops to protect him.'' The idea that quiet, sober Jim Hansen could be seen as a threat to anyone, let alone national security -- well, it was enough to make him laugh.But the brush with state censorship stayed with Hansen in the months ahead. It confirmed that even after the political triumph of the Montreal Protocol and the bipartisan support of climate policy, there were still people within the White House who hoped to prevent a debate. In its public statements, the administration showed no such reluctance: By all appearances, plans for major policy continued to advance rapidly. After the Johnston hearing, Timothy Wirth, a freshman Democratic senator from Colorado on the energy committee, began to plan a comprehensive package of climate-change legislation -- a New Deal for global warming. Wirth asked a legislative assistant, David Harwood, to consult with experts on the issue, beginning with Rafe Pomerance, in the hope of converting the science of climate change into a new national energy policy.In March 1988, Wirth joined 41 other senators, nearly half of them Republicans, to demand that Reagan call for an international treaty modeled after the ozone agreement. Because the United States and the Soviet Union were the world's two largest contributors of carbon emissions, responsible for about one-third of the world total, they should lead the negotiations. Reagan agreed. In May, he signed a joint statement with Mikhail Gorbachev that included a pledge to cooperate on global warming.But a pledge didn't reduce emissions. Hansen was learning to think more strategically -- less like a scientist, more like a politician. Despite the efforts of Wirth, there was as yet no serious plan nationally or internationally to address climate change. Even Al Gore himself had, for the moment, withdrawn his political claim to the issue. In 1987, at the age of 39, Gore announced that he was running for president, in part to bring attention to global warming, but he stopped emphasizing it after the subject failed to captivate New Hampshire primary voters.Hansen told Pomerance that the biggest problem with the Johnston hearing, at least apart from the whole censorship business, had been the month in which it was held: November. ''This business of having global-warming hearings in such cool weather is never going to get attention,'' he said. He wasn't joking. At first he assumed that it was enough to publish studies about global warming and that the government would spring into action. Then he figured that his statements to Congress would do it. It had seemed, at least momentarily, that industry, understanding what was at stake, might lead. But nothing had worked.As spring turned to summer, Anniek Hansen noticed a change in her husband's disposition. He grew pale and unusually thin. When she asked him about his day, Hansen replied with some ambiguity and turned the conversation to sports: the Yankees, his daughter's basketball team, his son's baseball team. But even for him, he was unusually quiet, serious, distracted. Anniek would begin a conversation and find that he hadn't heard a word she said. She knew what he was thinking: He was running out of time. We were running out of time. Then came the summer of 1988, and Jim Hansen wasn't the only one who could tell that time was running out.5. 'You Will See Things That You Shall Believe' Summer 1988It was the hottest and driest summer in history. Everywhere you looked, something was bursting into flames. Two million acres in Alaska incinerated, and dozens of major fires scored the West. Yellowstone National Park lost nearly one million acres. Smoke was visible from Chicago, 1,600 miles away.In Nebraska, suffering its worst drought since the Dust Bowl, there were days when every weather station registered temperatures above 100 degrees. The director of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment warned that the drought might be the dawning of a climatic change that within a half century could turn the state into a desert. ''The dang heat,'' said a farmer in Grinnell. ''Farming has so many perils, but climate is 99 percent of it.'' In parts of Wisconsin, where Gov. Tommy Thompson banned fireworks and smoking cigarettes outdoors, the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers evaporated completely. ''At that point,'' said an official from the Department of Natural Resources, ''we must just sit back and watch the fish die.''Harvard University, for the first time, closed because of heat. New York City's streets melted, its mosquito population quadrupled and its murder rate reached a record high. ''It's a chore just to walk,'' a former hostage negotiator told a reporter. ''You want to be left alone.'' The 28th floor of Los Angeles's second-tallest building burst into flames; the cause, the Fire Department concluded, was spontaneous combustion. Ducks fled the continental United States in search of wetlands, many ending up in Alaska, swelling the pintail population there to 1.5 million from 100,000. ''How do you spell relief?'' asked a spokesman for the Fish and Wildlife Service. ''If you are a duck from America's parched prairies, this year you may spell it A-L-A-S-K-A.''Nineteen Miss Indiana contestants, outfitted with raincoats and umbrellas, sang ''Come Rain or Come Shine,'' but it did not rain. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a Democratic presidential candidate, stood in an Illinois cornfield and prayed for rain, but it did not rain. Cliff Doebel, the owner of a gardening store in Clyde, Ohio, paid $2,000 to import Leonard Crow Dog, a Sioux Indian medicine man from Rosebud, S.D. Crow Dog claimed to have performed 127 rain dances, all successful. ''You will see things that you shall believe,'' he told the townspeople of Clyde. ''You will feel there is a chance for us all.'' After three days of dancing, it rained less than a quarter of an inch.Texas farmers fed their cattle cactus. Stretches of the Mississippi River flowed at less than one-fifth of normal capacity. Roughly 1,700 barges beached at Greenville, Miss.; an additional 2,000 were marooned at St. Louis and Memphis. The on-field thermometer at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, where the Phillies were hosting the Chicago Cubs for a matinee, read 130 degrees. During a pitching change, every player, coach and umpire, save the catcher and the entering reliever, Todd Frohwirth, fled into the dugouts. (Frohwirth would earn the victory.) In the Cleveland suburb of Lakewood on June 21, yet another record-smasher, a roofer working with 600-degree tar exclaimed, ''Will this madness ever end?''On June 22 in Washington, where it hit 100 degrees, Rafe Pomerance received a call from Jim Hansen, who was scheduled to testify the following morning at a Senate hearing called by Timothy Wirth.''I hope we have good media coverage tomorrow,'' Hansen said.This amused Pomerance. He was the one who tended to worry about press; Hansen usually claimed indifference to such vulgar considerations. ''Why's that?'' Pomerance asked.Hansen had just received the most recent global temperature data. Just over halfway into the year, 1988 was setting records. Already it had nearly clinched the hottest year in history. Ahead of schedule, the signal was emerging from the noise.''I'm going to make a pretty strong statement,'' Hansen said.6. 'The Signal Has Emerged' June 1988The night before the hearing, Hansen flew to Washington to give himself enough time to prepare his oral testimony in his hotel room. But he couldn't focus -- the ballgame was on the radio. The slumping Yankees, who had fallen behind the Tigers for first place, were trying to avoid a sweep in Detroit, and the game went to extra innings. Hansen fell asleep without finishing his statement. He awoke to bright sunlight, high humidity, choking heat. It was signal weather in Washington: the hottest June 23 in history.Before going to the Capitol, he attended a meeting at NASA headquarters. One of his early champions at the agency, Ichtiaque Rasool, was announcing the creation of a new carbon-dioxide program. Hansen, sitting in a room with dozens of scientists, continued to scribble his testimony under the table, barely listening. But he heard Rasool say that the goal of the new program was to determine when a warming signal might emerge. As you all know, Rasool said, no respectable scientist would say that you already have a signal.Hansen interrupted.''I don't know if he's respectable or not,'' he said, ''but I do know one scientist who is about to tell the U.S. Senate that the signal has emerged.''The other scientists looked up in surprise, but Rasool ignored Hansen and continued his presentation. Hansen returned to his testimony. He wrote: ''The global warming is now large enough that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause-and-effect relationship to the greenhouse effect.'' He wrote: ''1988 so far is so much warmer than 1987, that barring a remarkable and improbable cooling, 1988 will be the warmest year on record.'' He wrote: ''The greenhouse effect has been detected, and it is changing our climate now.''By 2:10 p.m., when the session began, it was 98 degrees, and not much cooler in Room 366 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building, thanks to the two rows of television-camera lights. Timothy Wirth's office had told reporters that the plain-spoken NASA scientist was going to make a major statement. After the staff members saw the cameras, even those senators who hadn't planned to attend appeared at the dais, hastily reviewing the remarks their aides had drafted for them. Half an hour before the hearing, Wirth pulled Hansen aside. He wanted to change the order of speakers, placing Hansen first. The senator wanted to make sure that Hansen's statement got the proper amount of attention. Hansen agreed.''We have only one planet,'' Senator Bennett Johnston intoned. ''If we screw it up, we have no place to go.'' Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat from Montana, called for the United Nations Environment Program to begin preparing a global remedy to the carbon-dioxide problem. Senator Dale Bumpers, a Democrat of Arkansas, previewed Hansen's testimony, saying that it ''ought to be cause for headlines in every newspaper in America tomorrow morning.'' The coverage, Bumpers emphasized, was a necessary precursor to policy. ''Nobody wants to take on any of the industries that produce the things that we throw up into the atmosphere,'' he said. ''But what you have are all these competing interests pitted against our very survival.''Wirth asked those standing in the gallery to claim the few remaining seats available. ''There is no point in standing up through this on a hot day,'' he said, happy for the occasion to emphasize the historical heat. Then he introduced the star witness.Hansen, wiping his brow, spoke without affect, his eyes rarely rising from his notes. The warming trend could be detected ''with 99 percent confidence,'' he said. ''It is changing our climate now.'' But he saved his strongest comment for after the hearing, when he was encircled in the hallway by reporters. ''It is time to stop waffling so much,'' he said, ''and say that the evidence is pretty strong that the greenhouse effect is here.''The press followed Bumpers's advice. Hansen's testimony prompted headlines in dozens of newspapers across the country, including The New York Times, which announced, across the top of its front page: ''Global Warming Has Begun, Expert Tells Senate.''But Hansen had no time to dwell on any of this. As soon as he got home to New York, Anniek told him she had breast cancer. She had found out two weeks earlier, but she didn't want to upset him before the hearing. In the following days, while the entire world tried to learn about James Hansen, he tried to learn about Anniek's illness. After he absorbed the initial shock and made a truce with the fear -- his grandmother died from the disease -- he dedicated himself to his wife's treatment with all the rigor of his profession. As they weighed treatment options and analyzed medical data, Anniek noticed him begin to change. The frustration of the last year began to fall away. It yielded, in those doctor's offices, to a steady coolness, an obsession for detail, a dogged optimism. He began to look like himself again.7. 'Woodstock For Climate Change' June 1988-April 1989In the immediate flush of optimism after the Wirth hearing -- henceforth known as the Hansen hearing -- Rafe Pomerance called his allies on Capitol Hill, the young staff members who advised politicians, organized hearings, wrote legislation. We need to finalize a number, he told them, a specific target, in order to move the issue -- to turn all this publicity into policy. The Montreal Protocol had called for a 50 percent reduction in CFC emissions by 1998. What was the right target for carbon emissions? It wasn't enough to exhort nations to do better. That kind of talk might sound noble, but it didn't change investments or laws. They needed a hard goal -- something ambitious but reasonable. And they needed it soon: Just four days after Hansen's star turn, politicians from 46 nations and more than 300 scientists would convene in Toronto at the World Conference on the Changing Atmosphere, an event described by Philip Shabecoff of The New York Times as ''Woodstock for climate change.''Pomerance hastily arranged a meeting with, among others, David Harwood, the architect of Wirth's climate legislation; Roger Dower in the Congressional Budget Office, who was calculating the plausibility of a national carbon tax; and Irving Mintzer, a colleague at the World Resources Institute who had a deep knowledge of energy economics. Wirth was scheduled to give the keynote address at Toronto -- Harwood would write it -- and could propose a number then. But which one?Pomerance had a proposal: a 20 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2000.Ambitious, Harwood said. In all his work planning climate policy, he had seen no assurance that such a steep drop in emissions was possible. Then again, 2000 was more than a decade off, so it allowed for some flexibility.What really mattered wasn't the number itself, Dower said, but simply that they settle on one. He agreed that a hard target was the only way to push the issue forward. Though his job at the C.B.O. required him to come up with precise estimates of speculative, complex policy, there wasn't time for yet another academic study to arrive at the exact right number. Pomerance's unscientific suggestion sounded fine to him.Mintzer pointed out that a 20 percent reduction was consistent with the academic literature on energy efficiency. Various studies over the years had shown that you could improve efficiency in most energy systems by roughly 20 percent if you adopted best practices. Of course, with any target, you had to take into account the fact that the developing world would inevitably consume much larger quantities of fossil fuels by 2000. But those gains could be offset by a wider propagation of the renewable technologies already at hand -- solar, wind, geothermal. It was not a rigorous scientific analysis, Mintzer granted, but 20 percent sounded plausible. We wouldn't need to solve cold fusion or ask Congress to repeal the law of gravity. We could manage it with the knowledge and technology we already had.Besides, Pomerance said, 20 by 2000 sounds good.In Toronto a few days later, Pomerance talked up his idea with everyone he met -- environmental ministers, scientists, journalists. Nobody thought it sounded crazy. He took that as an encouraging sign. Other delegates soon proposed the number to him independently, as if they had come up with it themselves. That was an even better sign.Wirth, in his keynote on June 27, called for the world to reduce emissions by 20 percent by 2000, with an eventual reduction of 50 percent. Other speakers likened the ramifications of climate change to a global nuclear war, but it was the emissions target that was heard in Washington, London, Berlin, Moscow. The conference's final statement, signed by all 400 scientists and politicians in attendance, repeated the demand with a slight variation: a 20 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2005. Just like that, Pomerance's best guess became global diplomatic policy.Hansen, emerging from Anniek's successful cancer surgery, took it upon himself to start a one-man public information campaign. He gave news conferences and was quoted in seemingly every article about the issue; he even appeared on television with homemade props. Like an entrant at an elementary-school science fair, he made ''loaded dice'' out of sections of cardboard and colored paper to illustrate the increased likelihood of hotter weather in a warmer climate. Public awareness of the greenhouse effect reached a new high of 68 percent.At the end of the sulfurous summer, several months after Gore ended his candidacy, global warming became a major subject of the presidential campaign. While Michael Dukakis proposed tax incentives to encourage domestic oil production and boasted that coal could satisfy the nation's energy needs for the next three centuries, George Bush took advantage. ''I am an environmentalist,'' he declared on the shore of Lake Erie, the first stop on a five-state environmental tour that would take him to Boston Harbor, Dukakis's home turf. ''Those who think we are powerless to do anything about the greenhouse effect,'' he said, ''are forgetting about the White House effect.'' His running mate emphasized the ticket's commitment to the issue at the vice-presidential debate. ''The greenhouse effect is an important environmental issue,'' Dan Quayle said. ''We need to get on with it. And in a George Bush administration, you can bet that we will.''This kind of talk roused the oil-and-gas men. ''A lot of people on the Hill see the greenhouse effect as the issue of the 1990s,'' a gas lobbyist told Oil & Gas Journal. Before a meeting of oil executives shortly after the ''environmentalist'' candidate won the election, Representative Dick Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, warned, ''It's going to be very difficult to fend off some kind of gasoline tax.'' The coal industry, which had the most to lose from restrictions on carbon emissions, had moved beyond denial to resignation. A spokesman for the National Coal Association acknowledged that the greenhouse effect was no longer ''an emerging issue. It is here already, and we'll be hearing more and more about it.''By the end of the year, 32 climate bills had been introduced in Congress, led by Wirth's omnibus National Energy Policy Act of 1988. Co-sponsored by 13 Democrats and five Republicans, it established as a national goal an ''International Global Agreement on the Atmosphere by 1992,'' ordered the Energy Department to submit to Congress a plan to reduce energy use by at least 2 percent a year through 2005 and directed the Congressional Budget Office to calculate the feasibility of a carbon tax. A lawyer for the Senate energy committee told an industry journal that lawmakers were ''frightened'' by the issue and predicted that Congress would eventually pass significant legislation after Bush took office.The other great powers refused to wait. The German Parliament created a special commission on climate change, which concluded that action had to be taken immediately, ''irrespective of any need for further research,'' and that the Toronto goal was inadequate; it recommended a 30 percent reduction of carbon emissions. The prime ministers of Canada and Norway called for a binding international treaty on the atmosphere; Sweden's Parliament went further, announcing a national strategy to stabilize emissions at the 1988 level and eventually imposing a carbon tax; and Margaret Thatcher, who had studied chemistry at Oxford, warned in a speech to the Royal Society that global warming could ''greatly exceed the capacity of our natural habitat to cope'' and that ''the health of the economy and the health of our environment are totally dependent upon each other.''It was at this time -- at a moment when the environmental movement was, in the words of one energy lobbyist, ''on a tear'' -- that the United Nations unanimously endorsed the establishment, by the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Program, of an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, composed of scientists and policymakers, to conduct scientific assessments and develop global climate policy. One of the I.P.C.C.'s first sessions to plan an international treaty was hosted by the State Department, 10 days after Bush's inauguration. James Baker chose the occasion to make his first speech as secretary of state. ''We can probably not afford to wait until all of the uncertainties about global climate change have been resolved,'' he said. ''Time will not make the problem go away.'' Much of Congress agreed: On April 14, 1989, a bipartisan group of 24 senators, led by the majority leader, George Mitchell, requested that Bush cut emissions in the United States even before the I.P.C.C.'s working group made its recommendation. ''We cannot afford the long lead times associated with a comprehensive global agreement,'' the senators wrote. Bush had promised to combat the greenhouse effect with the White House effect. The self-proclaimed environmentalist was now seated in the Oval Office. It was time.8. 'You Never Beat The White House' April 1989After Jim Baker gave his boisterous address to the I.P.C.C. working group at the State Department, he received a visit from John Sununu, Bush's chief of staff. Leave the science to the scientists, Sununu told Baker. Stay clear of this greenhouse-effect nonsense. You don't know what you're talking about.Baker, who had served as Reagan's chief of staff, didn't speak about the subject again. He later told the White House that he was recusing himself from energy-policy issues, on account of his previous career as a Houston oil-and-gas lawyer.Sununu, an enthusiastic contrarian, delighted in defying any lazy characterizations of himself. His father was a Lebanese exporter from Boston, and his mother was a Salvadoran of Greek ancestry; he was born in Havana. In his three terms as governor of New Hampshire, he had come, in the epithets of national political columnists, to embody Yankee conservatism: pragmatic, business-friendly, technocratic, ''no-nonsense.'' He had fought angrily against local environmentalists to open a nuclear power plant, but he had also signed the nation's first acid-rain legislation and lobbied Reagan directly for a reduction of sulfur-dioxide pollution by 50 percent, the target sought by the Audubon Society. He was perceived as more conservative than the president, a budget hawk who had turned a $44 million state deficit into a surplus without raising taxes, and openly insulted Republican politicians and the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce when they drifted, however tentatively, from his anti-tax doctrinairism. Yet he increased spending on mental health care and public-land preservation in New Hampshire, and in the White House he would help negotiate a tax increase and secure the Supreme Court nomination of David Souter.Bush had chosen Sununu for his political instincts -- he was credited with having won Bush the New Hampshire primary, after Bush came in third in Iowa, all but securing him the nomination. But despite his reputation as a political wolf, he still thought of himself as a scientist -- an ''old engineer,'' as he was fond of putting it, having earned a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from M.I.T. decades earlier. He lacked the reflexive deference that so many of his political generation reserved for the class of elite government scientists. Since World War II, he believed, conspiratorial forces had used the imprimatur of scientific knowledge to advance an ''anti-growth'' doctrine. He reserved particular disdain for Paul Ehrlich's ''The Population Bomb,'' which prophesied that hundreds of millions of people would starve to death if the world took no step to curb population growth; the Club of Rome, an organization of European scientists, heads of state and economists, which similarly warned that the world would run out of natural resources; and as recently as the mid-'70s, the hypothesis advanced by some of the nation's most celebrated scientists -- including Carl Sagan, Stephen Schneider and Ichtiaque Rasool -- that a new ice age was dawning, thanks to the proliferation of man-made aerosols. All were theories of questionable scientific merit, portending vast, authoritarian remedies to halt economic progress.Sununu had suspected that the greenhouse effect belonged to this nefarious cabal since 1975, when the anthropologist Margaret Mead convened a symposium on the subject at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. ''Unless the peoples of the world can begin to understand the immense and long-term consequences of what appear to be small immediate choices,'' Mead wrote, ''the whole planet may become endangered.'' Her conclusions were stark, immediate and absent the caveats that hobbled the scientific literature. Or as Sununu saw it, she showed her hand: ''Never before have the governing bodies of the world been faced with decisions so far-reaching,'' Mead wrote. ''It is inevitable that there will be a clash between those concerned with immediate problems and those who concern themselves with long-term consequences.'' When Mead talked about ''far-reaching'' decisions and ''long-term consequences,'' Sununu heard the marching of jackboots.In April, the director of the O.M.B., Richard Darman, a close ally of Sununu's, mentioned that the NASA scientist James Hansen, who had forced the issue of global warming onto the national agenda the previous summer, was going to testify again -- this time at a hearing called by Al Gore. Darman had the testimony and described it. Sununu was appalled: Hansen's language seemed extreme, based on scientific arguments that he considered, as he later put it, like ''technical garbage.''While Sununu and Darman reviewed Hansen's statements, the E.P.A. administrator, William K. Reilly, took a new proposal to the White House. The next meeting of the I.P.C.C.'s working group was scheduled for Geneva the following month, in May; it was the perfect occasion, Reilly argued, to take a stronger stand on climate change. Bush should demand a global treaty to reduce carbon emissions.Sununu disagreed. It would be foolish, he said, to let the nation stumble into a binding agreement on questionable scientific merits, especially as it would compel some unknown quantity of economic pain. They went back and forth. Reilly didn't want to cede leadership on the issue to the European powers; after all, the first high-level diplomatic meeting on climate change, to which Reilly was invited, would take place just a few months later in the Netherlands. Statements of caution would make the ''environmental president'' look like a hypocrite and hurt the United States' leverage in a negotiation. But Sununu wouldn't budge. He ordered the American delegates not to make any commitment in Geneva. Very soon after that, someone leaked the exchange to the press.Sununu, blaming Reilly, was furious. When accounts of his argument with Reilly appeared in The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post ahead of the Geneva I.P.C.C. meeting, they made the White House look as if it didn't know what it was doing.A deputy of Jim Baker pulled Reilly aside. He said he had a message from Baker, who had observed Reilly's infighting with Sununu. ''In the long run,'' the deputy warned Reilly, ''you never beat the White House.''9. 'A Form of Science Fraud' May 1989In the first week of May 1989, when Hansen received his proposed testimony back from the O.M.B., it was disfigured by deletions and, more incredible, additions. Gore had called the hearing to increase the pressure on Bush to sign major climate legislation; Hansen had wanted to use the occasion to clarify one major point that, in the hubbub following the 1988 hearing, had been misunderstood. Global warming would not only cause more heat waves and droughts like those of the previous summer but would also lead to more extreme rain events. This was crucial -- he didn't want the public to conclude, the next time there was a mild summer, that global warming wasn't real.But the edited text was a mess. For a couple of days, Hansen played along, accepting the more innocuous edits. But he couldn't accept some of the howlers proposed by the O.M.B. With the hearing only two days away, he gave up. He told NASA's congressional liaison to stop fighting. Let the White House have its way, he said.But Hansen would have his way, too. As soon as he hung up, he drafted a letter to Gore. He explained that the O.M.B. wanted him to demote his own scientific findings to ''estimates'' from models that were ''evolving'' and unreliable. His anonymous censor wanted him to say that the causes of global warming were ''scientifically unknown'' and might be attributable to ''natural processes,'' caveats that would not only render his testimony meaningless but make him sound like a moron. The most bizarre addition, however, was a statement of a different kind. He was asked to argue that Congress should only pass climate legislation that immediately benefited the economy, ''independent of concerns about an increasing greenhouse effect'' -- a sentence that no scientist would ever utter, unless perhaps he were employed by the American Petroleum Institute. Hansen faxed his letter to Gore and left the office.When he arrived home, Anniek told him Gore had called. Would it be all right, Gore asked when Hansen spoke with him, if I tell a couple of reporters about this?The New York Times's Philip Shabecoff called the next morning. ''I should be allowed to say what is my scientific position,'' Hansen told him. ''I can understand changing policy, but not science.''On Monday, May 8, the morning of the hearing, he left early for his flight to Washington and did not see the newspaper until he arrived at Dirksen, where Gore showed it to him. The front-page headline read: ''Scientist Says Budget Office Altered His Testimony.'' They agreed that Hansen would give his testimony as planned, after which Gore would ask about the passages that the O.M.B. had rewritten.Gore stopped at the door. ''We better go separately,'' he said. ''Otherwise they'll be able to get both of us with one hand grenade.''In the crowded hearing room, the cameras fixed on Hansen. He held his statement in one hand and a single Christmas tree bulb in the other -- a prop to help explain, however shakily, that the warming already created by fossil-fuel combustion was equivalent to placing a Christmas light over every square meter of Earth's surface. After Hansen read his sanitized testimony, Gore pounced. He was puzzled by inconsistencies in the distinguished scientist's presentation, he said in a tone thick with mock confusion. ''Why do you directly contradict yourself?''Hansen explained that he had not written those contradictory statements. ''The Bush administration is acting as if it is scared of the truth,'' Gore said. ''If they forced you to change a scientific conclusion, it is a form of science fraud.''Another government scientist testifying at the hearing, Jerry Mahlman from NOAA, acknowledged that the White House had previously tried to change his conclusions too. Mahlman had managed to deflect the worst of it, however -- ''objectionable and also unscientific'' recommendations, he said, that would have been ''severely embarrassing to me in the face of my scientific colleagues.''Gore called it ''an outrage of the first order of magnitude.'' The 1988 hearing had created a hero out of Jim Hansen. Now Gore had a real villain, one far more treacherous than Fred Koomanoff -- a nameless censor in the White House, hiding behind O.M.B. letterhead.The cameras followed Hansen and Gore into the marbled hallway. Hansen insisted that he wanted to focus on the science. Gore focused on the politics. ''I think they're scared of the truth,'' he said. ''They're scared that Hansen and the other scientists are right and that some dramatic policy changes are going to be needed, and they don't want to face up to it.''10. The White House Effect Fall 1989The censorship did more to publicize Hansen's testimony and the dangers of global warming than anything he could have possibly said. At the White House briefing later that morning, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater admitted that Hansen's statement had been changed. He blamed an official ''five levels down from the top'' and promised that there would be no retaliation. Hansen, he added, was ''an outstanding and distinguished scientist'' and was ''doing a great job.''The Los Angeles Times called the censorship ''an outrageous assault.'' The Chicago Tribune said it was the beginning of ''a cold war on global warming,'' and The New York Times warned that the White House's ''heavy-handed intervention sends the signal that Washington wants to go slow on addressing the greenhouse problem.''The day after the hearing, Gore received an unannounced visit from the O.M.B. director, Richard Darman. He came alone, without aides. He said he wanted to apologize to Gore in person. He was sorry, and he wanted Gore to know it; the O.M.B. would not try to censor anyone again. Gore, stunned, thanked Darman. Something about his apology -- the effusiveness, the mortified tone or perhaps the fact that he had come by himself, as if in secret -- left Gore with the impression that the idea to censor Hansen didn't come from someone five levels down from the top, or even below Darman. It had come from someone above Darman.Darman went to see Sununu. He didn't like being accused of censoring scientists. They needed to issue some kind of response. Sununu called Reilly to ask if he had any ideas. We could start, Reilly said, by recommitting to a global climate treaty. The United States was the only Western nation on record as opposing negotiations.Sununu sent a telegram to Geneva endorsing a plan ''to develop full international consensus on necessary steps to prepare for a formal treaty-negotiating process. The scope and importance of this issue are so great that it is essential for the U.S. to exercise leadership.'' He proposed an international workshop to improve the accuracy of the science and calculate the economic costs of emissions reductions. Sununu signed the telegram himself. A day later, the president pledged to host a climate workshop at the White House. Rafe Pomerance was unconvinced, telling the press that this belated effort to save face was a ''waffle'' that fell short of real action: ''We should be able to complete a treaty by the end of 1990,'' he said, ''not be starting one.'' But the general response from the press was relief and praise.Still, Sununu seethed at any mention of the subject. He had taken it upon himself to study more deeply the greenhouse effect; he would have a rudimentary, one-dimensional general circulation model installed on his personal desktop computer. He decided that the models promoted by Jim Hansen were a lot of bunk. They were horribly imprecise in scale and underestimated the ocean's ability to mitigate warming. Sununu complained about Hansen to D. Allan Bromley, a nuclear physicist from Yale who, at Sununu's recommendation, was named Bush's science adviser. Hansen's findings were ''technical poppycock'' that didn't begin to justify such wild-eyed pronouncements that ''the greenhouse effect is here'' or that the 1988 heat waves could be attributed to global warming, let alone serve as the basis for national economic policy.When a junior staff member in the Energy Department, in a meeting at the White House with Sununu and Reilly, mentioned an initiative to reduce fossil-fuel use, Sununu interrupted her. ''Why in the world would you need to reduce fossil-fuel use?'' he asked. ''Because of climate change,'' the young woman replied.''I don't want anyone in this administration without a scientific background using 'climate change' or 'global warming' ever again,'' he said. ''If you don't have a technical basis for policy, don't run around making decisions on the basis of newspaper headlines.'' After the meeting, Reilly caught up to the staff member in the hallway. She was shaken. Don't take it personally, Reilly told her. Sununu might have been looking at you, but that was directed at me.Relations between Sununu and Reilly became openly adversarial. Reilly, Sununu thought, was a creature of the environmental lobby. He was trying to impress his friends at the E.P.A. without having a basic grasp of the science himself. Most unforgivable of all was what Sununu saw as Reilly's propensity to leak to the press. Whenever Reilly sent the White House names of candidates he wanted to hire for openings at the E.P.A., Sununu vetoed them. When it came time for the high-level diplomatic meeting in November, a gathering of environmental ministers in the Netherlands, Sununu didn't trust Reilly to negotiate on behalf of the White House. So he sent Allan Bromley to accompany him.Reilly, for his part, didn't entirely blame Sununu for Bush's indecision on the prospect of a climate treaty. The president had never taken a vigorous interest in global warming and was mainly briefed about it by nonscientists. Bush had brought up the subject on the campaign trail, in his speech about the White House effect, after leafing through a briefing booklet for a new issue that might generate some positive press. When Reilly tried in person to persuade him to take action, Bush deferred to Sununu and Baker. Why don't the three of you work it out, he said. Let me know when you decide. But by the time Reilly got to the Noordwijk Ministerial Conference in the Netherlands, he suspected that it was already too late.11. 'The Skunks at The Garden Party' November 1989Rafe Pomerance awoke at sunlight and stole out of his hotel, making for the flagpoles. It was nearly freezing -- Nov. 6, 1989, on the coast of the North Sea in the Dutch resort town of Noordwijk -- but the wind had yet to rise and the photographer was waiting. More than 60 flags lined the strand between the hotel and the beach, one for each nation in attendance at the first major diplomatic meeting on global warming. The delegations would review the progress made by the I.P.C.C. and decide whether to endorse a framework for a global treaty. There was a general sense among the delegates that they would, at minimum, agree to the target proposed by the host, the Dutch environmental minister, more modest than the Toronto number: a freezing of greenhouse-gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2000. Some believed that if the meeting was a success, it would encourage the I.P.C.C. to accelerate its negotiations and reach a decision about a treaty sooner. But at the very least, the world's environmental ministers should sign a statement endorsing a hard, binding target of emissions reductions. The mood among the delegates was electric, nearly giddy -- after more than a decade of fruitless international meetings, they could finally sign an agreement that meant something.Pomerance had not been among the 400 delegates invited to Noordwijk. But together with three young activists -- Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club, Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists and Stewart Boyle from Friends of the Earth -- he had formed his own impromptu delegation. Their constituency, they liked to say, was the climate itself. Their mission was to pressure the delegates to include in the final conference statement, which would be used as the basis for a global treaty, the target proposed in Toronto: a 20 percent reduction of greenhouse-gas combustion by 2005. It was the only measure that mattered, the amount of emissions reductions, and the Toronto number was the strongest global target yet proposed.The activists booked their own travel and doubled up in rooms at a beat-up motel down the beach. They managed to secure all-access credentials from the Dutch environmental ministry's press secretary. He was inclined to be sympathetic toward the activists because it had been rumored that Allan Bromley, one of the United States' lead delegates, would try to persuade the delegates from Japan and the Soviet Union to join him in resisting the idea of a binding agreement, despite the fact that Bush had again claimed just earlier that week that the United States would ''play a leadership role in global warming.'' The Dutch were especially concerned about this development, as even a minor rise in sea level would swamp much of their nation.The activists planned to stage a stunt each day to embarrass Bromley and galvanize support for a hard treaty. The first took place at the flagpoles, where they met a photographer from Agence France-Presse at dawn. Performing for the photographer, Boyle and Becker lowered the Japanese, Soviet and American flags to half-staff. Becker gave a reporter an outraged statement, accusing the three nations of conspiring to block the one action necessary to save the planet. The article appeared on front pages across Europe.On the second day, Pomerance and Becker met an official from Kiribati, an island nation of 33 atolls in the middle of the Pacific Ocean about halfway between Hawaii and Australia. They asked if he was Kiribati's environmental minister.Kiribati is a very small place, the man said. I do everything. I'm the environmental minister. I'm the science minister. I'm everything. If the sea rises, he said, my entire nation will be underwater.Pomerance and Becker exchanged a look. ''If we set up a news conference,'' Pomerance asked, ''will you tell them what you just told us?''Within minutes, they had assembled a couple dozen journalists.There is no place on Kiribati taller than my head, began the minister, who seemed barely more than five feet tall. So when we talk about one-foot sea-level rise, that means the water is up to my shin.He pointed to his shin.Two feet, he said, that's my thigh.He pointed to his thigh.Three feet, that's my waist.He pointed to his waist.Am I making myself clear?Pomerance and Becker were ecstatic. The minister came over to them. Is that what you had in mind? he asked.It was a good start, and necessary too -- Pomerance had the sinking feeling that the momentum of the previous year was beginning to flag. The censoring of Hansen's testimony and the inexplicably strident opposition from John Sununu were ominous signs. So were the findings of a report Pomerance had commissioned, published in September by the World Resources Institute, tracking global greenhouse-gas emissions. The United States was the largest contributor by far, producing nearly a quarter of the world's carbon emissions, and its contribution was growing faster than that of every other country. Bush's indecision, or perhaps inattention, had already managed to delay the negotiation of a global climate treaty until 1990 at the earliest, perhaps even 1991. By then, Pomerance worried, it would be too late.The one meeting to which Pomerance's atmospheric delegation could not gain admittance was the only one that mattered: the final negotiation. The scientists and I.P.C.C. staff members were asked to leave; just the environmental ministers remained. Pomerance and the other activists haunted the carpeted hallway outside the conference room, waiting and thinking. A decade earlier, Pomerance helped warn the White House of the dangers posed by fossil-fuel combustion; nine years earlier, at a fairy-tale castle on the Gulf of Mexico, he tried to persuade Congress to write climate legislation, reshape American energy policy and demand that the United States lead an international process to arrest climate change. Just one year ago, he devised the first emissions target to be proposed at a major international conference. Now, at the end of the decade, senior diplomats from all over the world were debating the merits of a binding climate treaty. Only he was powerless to participate. He could only trust, as he stared at the wall separating him from the diplomats and their muffled debate, that all his work had been enough.The meeting began in the morning and continued into the night, much longer than expected; most of the delegates had come to the conference ready to sign the Dutch proposal. Each time the doors opened and a minister headed to the bathroom at the other end of the hall, the activists leapt up, asking for an update. The ministers maintained a studied silence, but as the negotiations went past midnight, their aggravation was recorded in their stricken faces and opened collars.''What's happening?'' Becker shouted, for the hundredth time, as the Swedish minister surfaced.''Your government,'' the minister said, ''is fucking this thing up!''When the beaten delegates finally emerged from the conference room, Becker and Pomerance learned what happened. Bromley, at the urging of John Sununu and with the acquiescence of Britain, Japan and the Soviet Union, had forced the conference to abandon the commitment to freeze emissions. The final statement noted only that ''many'' nations supported stabilizing emissions -- but did not indicate which nations or at what emissions level. And with that, a decade of excruciating, painful, exhilarating progress turned to air.The environmentalists spent the morning giving interviews and writing news releases. ''You must conclude the conference is a failure,'' Becker said, calling the dissenting nations ''the skunks at the garden party.'' Greenpeace called it a ''disaster.'' Timothy Wirth, in Washington, said the outcome was proof that the United States was ''not a leader but a delinquent partner.''Pomerance tried to be more diplomatic. ''The president made a commitment to the American people to deal with global warming,'' he told The Washington Post, ''and he hasn't followed it up.'' He didn't want to sound defeated. ''There are some good building blocks here,'' Pomerance said, and he meant it. The Montreal Protocol on CFCs wasn't perfect at first, either -- it had huge loopholes and weak restrictions. Once in place, however, the restrictions could be tightened. Perhaps the same could happen with climate change. Perhaps. Pomerance was not one for pessimism. As William Reilly told reporters, dutifully defending the official position forced upon him, it was the first time that the United States had formally endorsed the concept of an emissions limit. Pomerance wanted to believe that this was progress.Before leaving the Netherlands, he joined the other activists for a final round of drinks and commiseration. He would have to return to Washington the next day and start all over again. The I.P.C.C.'s next policy-group meeting would take place in Edinburgh in two months, and there was concern that the Noordwijk failure might influence the group members into lowering their expectations for a treaty. But Pomerance refused to be dejected -- there was no point to it. His companions, though more openly disappointed, shared his determination. One of them, Daniel Becker, had just found out that his wife was pregnant with their first child.She had traveled with Becker to the Netherlands to visit friends before the conference started. One day, their hosts took them on a day trip to Zeeland, a southwestern province where three rivers emptied into the sea. All week in Noordwijk, Becker couldn't stop talking about what he had seen in Zeeland. After a flood in 1953, when the sea swallowed much of the region, killing more than 2,000 people, the Dutch began to build the Delta Works, a vast concrete-and-steel fortress of movable barriers, dams and sluice gates -- a masterpiece of human engineering. The whole system could be locked into place within 90 minutes, defending the land against storm surge. It reduced the country's exposure to the sea by 700 kilometers, Becker explained. The United States coastline was about 153,000 kilometers long. How long, he asked, was the entire terrestrial coastline? Because the whole world was going to need this. In Zeeland, he said, he had seen the future.EpilogueKen Caldeira, a climate scientist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Stanford, Calif., has a habit of asking new graduate students to name the largest fundamental breakthrough in climate physics since 1979. It's a trick question. There has been no breakthrough. As with any mature scientific discipline, there is only refinement. The computer models grow more precise; the regional analyses sharpen; estimates solidify into observational data. Where there have been inaccuracies, they have tended to be in the direction of understatement. Caldeira and a colleague recently published a paper in Nature finding that the world is warming more quickly than most climate models predict. The toughest emissions reductions now being proposed, even by the most committed nations, will probably fail to achieve ''any given global temperature stabilization target.''More carbon has been released into the atmosphere since the final day of the Noordwijk conference, Nov. 7, 1989, than in the entire history of civilization preceding it. In 1990, humankind burned more than 20 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. By 2017, the figure had risen to 32.5 billion metric tons, a record. Despite every action taken since the Charney report -- the billions of dollars invested in research, the nonbinding treaties, the investments in renewable energy -- the only number that counts, the total quantity of global greenhouse gas emitted per year, has continued its inexorable rise.Like the scientific story, the political story hasn't changed greatly, except in its particulars. Even some of the nations that pushed hardest for climate policy have failed to honor their own commitments. When it comes to our own nation, which has failed to make any binding commitments whatsoever, the dominant narrative for the last quarter century has concerned the efforts of the fossil-fuel industries to suppress science, confuse public knowledge and bribe politicians.The mustache-twirling depravity of these campaigns has left the impression that the oil-and-gas industry always operated thus; while the Exxon scientists and American Petroleum Institute clerics of the '70s and '80s were hardly good Samaritans, they did not start multimillion-dollar disinformation campaigns, pay scientists to distort the truth or try to brainwash children in elementary schools, as their successors would. It was James Hansen's testimony before Congress in 1988 that, for the first time since the ''Changing Climate'' report, made oil-and-gas executives begin to consider the issue's potential to hurt their profits. Exxon, as ever, led the field. Six weeks after Hansen's testimony, Exxon's manager of science and strategy development, Duane LeVine, prepared an internal strategy paper urging the company to ''emphasize the uncertainty in scientific conclusions.'' This shortly became the default position of the entire sector. LeVine, it so happened, served as chairman of the global petroleum industry's Working Group on Global Climate Change, created the same year, which adopted Exxon's position as its own.The American Petroleum Institute, after holding a series of internal briefings on the subject in the fall and winter of 1988, including one for the chief executives of the dozen or so largest oil companies, took a similar, if slightly more diplomatic, line. It set aside money for carbon-dioxide policy -- about $100,000, a fraction of the millions it was spending on the health effects of benzene, but enough to establish a lobbying organization called, in an admirable flourish of newspeak, the Global Climate Coalition. It was joined by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 14 other trade associations, including those representing the coal, electric-grid and automobile industries. The G.C.C. was conceived as a reactive body, to share news of any proposed regulations, but on a whim, it added a press campaign, to be coordinated mainly by the A.P.I. It gave briefings to politicians known to be friendly to the industry and approached scientists who professed skepticism about global warming. The A.P.I.'s payment for an original op-ed was $2,000.The chance to enact meaningful measures to prevent climate change was vanishing, but the industry had just begun. In October 1989, scientists allied with the G.C.C. began to be quoted in national publications, giving an issue that lacked controversy a convenient fulcrum. ''Many respected scientists say the available evidence doesn't warrant the doomsday warnings,'' was the caveat that began to appear in articles on climate change.Cheap and useful, G.C.C.-like groups started to proliferate, but it was not until international negotiations in preparation for the 1992 Rio Earth Summit began that investments in persuasion peddling rose to the level of a line item. At Rio, George H.W. Bush refused to commit to specific emissions reductions. The following year, when President Bill Clinton proposed an energy tax in the hope of meeting the goals of the Rio treaty, the A.P.I. invested $1.8 million in a G.C.C. disinformation campaign. Senate Democrats from oil-and-coal states joined Republicans to defeat the tax proposal, which later contributed to the Republicans' rout of Democrats in the midterm congressional elections in 1994 -- the first time the Republican Party had won control of both houses in 40 years. The G.C.C. spent $13 million on a single ad campaign intended to weaken support for the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which committed its parties to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 5 percent relative to 1990 levels. The Senate, which would have had to ratify the agreement, took a pre-emptive vote declaring its opposition; the resolution passed 95-0. There has never been another serious effort to negotiate a binding global climate treaty.The G.C.C. disbanded in 2002 after the defection of various members who were embarrassed by its tactics. But Exxon (now Exxon Mobil) continued its disinformation campaign for another half decade. This has made the corporation an especially vulnerable target for the wave of compensatory litigation that began in earnest in the last three years and may last a generation. Tort lawsuits have become possible only in recent years, as scientists have begun more precisely to attribute regional effects to global emission levels. This is one subfield of climate science that has advanced significantly since 1979 -- the assignment of blame.A major lawsuit has targeted the federal government. A consortium of 21 American children and young adults -- one of whom, Sophie Kivlehan of Allentown, Pa., is Jim Hansen's granddaughter -- claims that the government, by ''creating a national energy system that causes climate change,'' has violated its duty to protect the natural resources to which all Americans are entitled.In 2015, after reports by the website InsideClimate News and The Los Angeles Times documented the climate studies performed by Exxon for decades, the attorneys general of Massachusetts and New York began fraud investigations. The Securities and Exchange Commission separately started to investigate whether Exxon Mobil's valuation depended on the burning of all its known oil-and-gas reserves. (Exxon Mobil has denied any wrongdoing and stands by its valuation method.)The rallying cry of this multipronged legal effort is ''Exxon Knew.'' It is incontrovertibly true that senior employees at the company that would later become Exxon, like those at most other major oil-and-gas corporations, knew about the dangers of climate change as early as the 1950s. But the automobile industry knew, too, and began conducting its own research by the early 1980s, as did the major trade groups representing the electrical grid. They all own responsibility for our current paralysis and have made it more painful than necessary. But they haven't done it alone.The United States government knew. Roger Revelle began serving as a Kennedy administration adviser in 1961, five years after establishing the Mauna Loa carbon-dioxide program, and every president since has debated the merits of acting on climate policy. Carter had the Charney report, Reagan had ''Changing Climate'' and Bush had the censored testimony of James Hansen and his own public vow to solve the problem. Congress has been holding hearings for 40 years; the intelligence community has been tracking the crisis even longer.Everybody knew. In 1958, on prime-time television, ''The Bell Science Hour'' -- one of the most popular educational film series in American history -- aired ''The Unchained Goddess,'' a film about meteorological wonders, produced by Frank Capra, a dozen years removed from ''It's a Wonderful Life,'' warning that ''man may be unwittingly changing the world's climate'' through the release of carbon dioxide. ''A few degrees' rise in the Earth's temperature would melt the polar ice caps,'' says the film's kindly host, the bespectacled Dr. Research. ''An inland sea would fill a good portion of the Mississippi Valley. Tourists in glass-bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of Miami through 150 feet of tropical water.'' Capra's film was shown in science classes for decades.Everyone knew -- and we all still know. We know that the transformations of our planet, which will come gradually and suddenly, will reconfigure the political world order. We know that if we don't act to reduce emissions, we risk the collapse of civilization. We also know that, without a gargantuan intervention, whatever happens will be worse for our children, worse yet for their children and even worse still for their children's children, whose lives, our actions have demonstrated, mean nothing to us.Could it have been any other way? In the late 1970s, a small group of philosophers, economists and political scientists began to debate, largely among themselves, whether a human solution to this human problem was even possible. They did not trouble themselves about the details of warming, taking the worst-case scenario as a given. They asked instead whether humankind, when presented with this particular existential crisis, was willing to prevent it. We worry about the future. But how much, exactly?The answer, as any economist could tell you, is very little. Economics, the science of assigning value to human behavior, prices the future at a discount; the farther out you project, the cheaper the consequences. This makes the climate problem the perfect economic disaster. The Yale economist William D. Nordhaus, a member of Jimmy Carter's Council of Economic Advisers, argued in the 1970s that the most appropriate remedy was a global carbon tax. But that required an international agreement, which Nordhaus didn't think was likely. Michael Glantz, a political scientist who was at the National Center for Atmospheric Research at the time, argued in 1979 that democratic societies are constitutionally incapable of dealing with the climate problem. The competition for resources means that no single crisis can ever command the public interest for long, yet climate change requires sustained, disciplined efforts over decades. And the German physicist-philosopher Klaus Meyer-Abich argued that any global agreement would inevitably favor the most minimal action. Adaptation, Meyer-Abich concluded, ''seems to be the most rational political option.'' It is the option that we have pursued, consciously or not, ever since.These theories share a common principle: that human beings, whether in global organizations, democracies, industries, political parties or as individuals, are incapable of sacrificing present convenience to forestall a penalty imposed on future generations. When I asked John Sununu about his part in this history -- whether he considered himself personally responsible for killing the best chance at an effective global-warming treaty -- his response echoed Meyer-Abich. ''It couldn't have happened,'' he told me, ''because, frankly, the leaders in the world at that time were at a stage where they were all looking how to seem like they were supporting the policy without having to make hard commitments that would cost their nations serious resources.'' He added, ''Frankly, that's about where we are today.''If human beings really were able to take the long view -- to consider seriously the fate of civilization decades or centuries after our deaths -- we would be forced to grapple with the transience of all we know and love in the great sweep of time. So we have trained ourselves, whether culturally or evolutionarily, to obsess over the present, worry about the medium term and cast the long term out of our minds, as we might spit out a poison.Like most human questions, the carbon-dioxide question will come down to fear. At some point, the fears of young people will overwhelm the fears of the old. Some time after that, the young will amass enough power to act. It will be too late to avoid some catastrophes, but perhaps not others. Humankind is nothing if not optimistic, even to the point of blindness. We are also an adaptable species. That will help.The distant perils of climate change are no longer very distant, however. Many have already begun to occur. We are capable of good works, altruism and wisdom, and a growing number of people have devoted their lives to helping civilization avoid the worst. We have a solution in hand: carbon taxes, increased investment in renewable and nuclear energy and decarbonization technology. As Jim Hansen told me, ''From a technology and economics standpoint, it is still readily possible to stay under two degrees Celsius.'' We can trust the technology and the economics. It's harder to trust human nature. Keeping the planet to two degrees of warming, let alone 1.5 degrees, would require transformative action. It will take more than good works and voluntary commitments; it will take a revolution. But in order to become a revolutionary, you need first to suffer.Hansen's most recent paper, published last year, announced that Earth is now as warm as it was before the last ice age, 115,000 years ago, when the seas were more than six meters higher than they are today. He and his team have concluded that the only way to avoid dangerous levels of warming is to bend the emissions arc below the x-axis. We must, in other words, find our way to ''negative emissions,'' extracting more carbon dioxide from the air than we contribute to it. If emissions, by miracle, do rapidly decline, most of the necessary carbon absorption could be handled by replanting forests and improving agricultural practices. If not, ''massive technological COâ‚‚ extraction,'' using some combination of technologies as yet unperfected or uninvented, will be required. Hansen estimates that this will incur costs of $89 trillion to $535 trillion this century, and may even be impossible at the necessary scale. He is not optimistic.Like Hansen, Rafe Pomerance is close to his granddaughter. When he feels low, he wears a bracelet she made for him. He finds it difficult to explain the future to her. During the Clinton administration, Pomerance worked on environmental issues for the State Department; he is now a consultant for Rethink Energy Florida, which hopes to alert the state to the threat of rising seas, and the chairman of Arctic 21, a network of scientists and research organizations that hope ''to communicate the ongoing unraveling of the Arctic.'' Every two months, he has lunch with fellow veterans of the climate wars -- E.P.A. officials, congressional staff members and colleagues from the World Resources Institute. They bemoan the lost opportunities, the false starts, the strategic blunders. But they also remember their achievements. In a single decade, they turned a crisis that was studied by no more than several dozen scientists into the subject of Senate hearings, front-page headlines and the largest diplomatic negotiation in world history. They helped summon into being the world's climate watchdog, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and initiated the negotiations for a treaty signed by nearly all of the world's nations.It is true that much of the damage that might have been avoided is now inevitable. And Pomerance is not the romantic he once was. But he still believes that it might not be too late to preserve some semblance of the world as we know it. Human nature has brought us to this place; perhaps human nature will one day bring us through. Rational argument has failed in a rout. Let irrational optimism have a turn. It is also human nature, after all, to hope.Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of The New York Times Magazine delivered to your inbox every week.GraphicPHOTOS: Rafe Pomerance in 1983.

"8","Article 8","A couple of months ago, before the Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded and began spewing tens of millions of gallons of raw crude into the Gulf of Mexico, Dave Rauschkolb was just some guy with an improbable-some might even call it loopy-dream. A surfer and the owner of three restaurants in Seaside, Florida, Rauschkolb had almost single-handedly organized 10,000 people to gather on 90 Florida beaches and join hands one Saturday in February to protest an offshore-oil-drilling bill that was making its way through the State Legislature. He'd called the event ""Hands Across the Sand."" In April, after President Obama announced that he would open up vast new expanses of America's seawaters to offshore drilling, Rauschkolb heard from a woman in Virginia and a man in New Jersey who wanted to hold similar events on their beaches. He offered to help. Then the BP oil spill happened, and Rauschkolb had an idea. What if he took ""Hands Across the Sand"" national? He envisioned throngs of Americans joining hands on beaches all over the United States and, before long, he wasn't the only one dreaming big.When the Deepwater Horizon disaster occurred on April 20, the American environmental movement was already suffering perhaps the lowest morale of its 40-year existence. What had become environmentalists' primary mission-to convince the world to do something about climate change-was, after a few hopeful years, rapidly slipping away from them. Climate activists were being outmaneuvered by the highly superior political-media operation of their fossil-fuel-industry-funded opponents. The chances of enacting any meaningful climate legislation in the United States-an essential precursor to getting the rest of the world to act-were dropping precipitously. And now, from 50 miles off the Louisiana coast and nearly a mile under the Gulf of Mexico, came this terrible, visceral image of self-inflicted environmental destruction caused by our addiction to oil. ""Those of us who have worked on global warming for decades just can't believe that here we are in a society that really has made almost no change based on the warnings that have come out,"" John Passacantando, the former executive director of Greenpeace USA, says. ""The deep feelings of hurt and failure triggered by the spill are just overwhelming.""And yet any environmental activist who has been in the game long enough knows the power of a good catastrophe. ""We really worry about the spill itself, but in the past it seems to have taken horrific events like this to wake people up,"" says Bill McKibben, the environmental writer and founder of the climate-change group 350.org. In 1969, the Santa Barbara oil spill and the burning Cuyahoga River helped give birth to the first Earth Day, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Clean Air Act; in 1979, the Three Mile Island accident gave a dramatic boost to the anti-nuclear movement. ""One hopes that what's happening in the gulf will have some of the same kind of effect,"" McKibben says. ""This has the potential to be a galvanizing moment for the climate movement."" The Obama administration appears to have reached a similar conclusion. After spending his first eighteen months in the White House refusing to aggressively push for meaningful climate and energy legislation-reportedly at the behest of Rahm Emanuel, who deemed the issue a political loser-Obama, seeking to capitalize on the spill, has now apparently devised a plan that he hopes could get a bill on his desk before the end of the year.Granted, it takes a couple of steps of logic to get from Deepwater to the warming of the planet-to explain how even if the oil now spewing into the gulf had ended up in our gas tanks, it would have done environmental damage. But given how unsuccessfully the environmental movement has pressed the rational case for climate-change action, some activists are wondering whether rational, dispassionate thinking is overrated. Over the last few months, they have begun to subtly (and not so subtly) shift their messaging away from scientific, or even explicitly environmental, arguments and toward more direct, emotional, and, frankly, manipulative appeals. ""The problem with the environmental movement is not that it hasn't been polite enough, it's that it's been too polite,"" says Passacantando. ""Henry David Thoreau was once asked if he regretted anything, and he said, 'If I repent of anything it is very likely to be my good behavior.' I think that's what we might take from the Deepwater-well blowout and the failure to pass meaningful climate-change legislation.""So while the live-streaming underwater oil cam and the photos of oil-slickened pelicans are fresh on everyone's mind, activists have begun working them to their advantage. When they heard of Rauschkolb's highly visible (and relatively easy to engage) Hands Across the Sand stunt, the Sierra Club delivered about 25 of its top field staffers to organize beaches in eighteen states and Greenpeace sent five employees and 500 of its top volunteer activists. McKibben's group 350.org made sure that members of Congress were invited to events at beaches in their districts. Friends of the Earth's media team taught local organizers how to write press releases and deal with reporters. All told, more than a dozen national environmental groups, as well as liberal groups like MoveOn, signed on as sponsors and activated their massive e-mail lists.Which means that at noon on Saturday, June 26, organizers hope that hundreds of thousands of people in almost every state (and more than a dozen countries) will go to their beaches (or somewhere symbolic, like the White House) and hold hands in what could be the most visible public response to the environmental catastrophe in the gulf to date. ""People have been asking, 'Where's the outrage?'?"" says the Sierra Club's Frank Jackalone. ""The outrage is going to be very clear on June 26. Hands Across the Sand will be a major turning point to push things in the other direction and toward a clean-energy future.""It was only two summers ago that Barack Obama and John McCain were each pledging, if elected president, to dramatically cut greenhouse-gas emissions and, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll, 80 percent of Americans believed global warming was real. Then the roof began to cave in.Between Obama's Iowa caucus win and his inauguration, Pew found a fifteen-point drop in the number of Americans who believed global warming should be a ""top priority."" The economy was tanking, and the White House's new occupant decided that passing comprehensive climate legislation would have to take a backseat to dealing with the financial crisis and achieving health-care reform.Last November, a Washington Post-ABC News poll detected an eight-point drop in the number of Americans who believed global warming was happening. That same month, thousands of private e-mails between prominent British and American climate researchers were hacked from a computer server at the University of East Anglia. The e-mails, while embarrassing (in one, a climatologist describes the death of a leading climate-change skeptic as ""cheering news"") did nothing to undermine the science behind global warming. But that didn't stop global-warming deniers from claiming the e-mails did just that (""This is not a smoking gun; this is a mushroom cloud,"" one told the Times) and, in a feat of political jujitsu reminiscent of the Swift Boat vets, spinning them into a pseudoscandal that was soon dubbed ""Climate-gate.""In December, the United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen-the culmination of a two-year process that was supposed to result in an international treaty curbing carbon emissions-ended without any binding agreement, in no small part because of the failure of the U.S. to enact its own climate legislation. Then, in February, an epic blizzard blanketed much of the East Coast-including America's media and political capitals-with several feet of snow. ""It's the most severe winter storm in years, which would seem to contradict Al Gore's hysterical global-warming theories,"" Sean Hannity crowed from the Fox News studio in New York. Meanwhile, in Washington, Oklahoma senator Jim Inhofe-Congress's No. 1 climate-change denier-built an igloo near the Capitol and festooned it with signs reading HONK IF YOU ? GLOBAL WARMING. The following month, Gallup reported that 48 percent of Americans thought the seriousness of global warming was exaggerated-the highest percentage since it started asking the question thirteen years ago.The relentless string of setbacks the climate movement had been subjected to over the preceding eighteen months had coalesced into something worse. ""It wasn't just drip, drip, drip,"" says one climate activist. ""We were past that. The patient was bleeding out.""Worst of all, the rapid collapse of the public consensus on climate change had occurred at a time when the scientific consensus about global warming was growing stronger. ""After $100 million has been spent in the last year, why don't have we have more power?"" Betsy Taylor, co-founder of the climate-change group 1Sky, found herself wondering this spring. ""Why isn't this a hot-button issue? Why haven't we engaged more deeply with the public?""Or as Andrew Revkin, who late last year left his job as the Times' climate-and-environment reporter to write an opinion blog for the paper's website and work as a senior fellow for environmental understanding at Pace University, puts it, ""I could spend the next twenty years trying to write really good stories about climate, the way I've spent the last twenty years doing that, but I lost the sense that that was a route to efficacy. If the social-psychology research shows people don't change their stances on these issues based on new information, and I'm in the information business, then what the hell am I doing?""The elemental mistake environmentalists made over the last few years-and one that Al Gore in particular can be faulted for-was assuming that people approach the subject of climate change the way environmentalists do: seriously. But they don't. For a few reasons, including perhaps the fact that the threat poses a planetary existential crisis, Americans are wildly impressionable, inconsistent, and illogical in their opinions on the subject. Indeed, public consensus in some respects can be as unstable as the weather: Jon A. Krosnick, a social psychologist at Stanford, has attributed some of the lower polls in part to an unusually cool 2008 and this past harsh winter.Although the release of An Inconvenient Truth was hailed as a seminal moment for the climate movement-in language not dissimilar to that of environmentalists talking about the BP spill-in hindsight the documentary was a decidedly mixed blessing. ""Most of the people who went to see that are what I'd call mainstream liberal Democrats,"" says Anthony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication. ""They liked Al Gore, they trusted Al Gore, they voted for Al Gore. For God's sake, they were willing to plunk down good money to watch the guy do a slideshow."" The movie, in other words, persuaded the persuadable. But for those not interested in accepting climate-change science, the film set itself up as an easy scapegoat. ""An Inconvenient Truth intensified the polarization, because Gore is fundamentally a politician, no matter how many hours he spends looking at sea-ice models,"" says Revkin. ""And that will always hamper his credibility with a portion of America."" In a January survey, Leiserowitz found that 53 percent of Americans didn't trust Gore on global warming.If you're marketing a product, consumer irrationality can be very helpful; a confused consumer is an easily manipulated one. But while the original Earth Day is a triumph of modern branding-and corporate America has become expert at slapping the ""green"" label on its wares-environmentalists have struggled to come up with a successful formula for selling climate change. They still, for instance, aren't even quite sure what to call it. Some prefer ""global warming"" since most people don't like hot weather. Others like ""climate change"" on the grounds that higher temperatures won't be the only dangerous outcome. Still others, like Gore, are partial to ""climate crisis."" There's even disagreement about the greenhouse analogy. Some environmentalists prefer the ""blanket effect,"" arguing that people are more familiar with blankets than greenhouses-only to face the counterargument that blankets are too warm and fuzzy.A much bigger misstep has been to talk about climate change as an ""environmental"" problem. Leiserowitz, who has been conducting a series of surveys on Americans' attitudes about climate change since 2002, has found that their most frequent association upon hearing the words ""global warming"" is ""melting ice,"" followed by ""rising temperatures,"" and then ""impacts on nonhuman nature,"" such as polar bears. ""People overwhelmingly say melting ice is a very bad thing,"" he explains. ""The problem is that hardly any Americans live next to a melting glacier. It just reinforces the idea that the consequences are very distant.""""The fact that the issue has been framed as an environmental issue instead of a human-well-being issue is fundamentally problematic,"" says Ed Maibach, the director of George Mason University's Center for Climate Change Communication. ""It needs to be portrayed as something that's going to harm us and our loved ones, because that's the kind of thing we respond to.""Even before the brown pelican became the iconic image of the Deepwater explosion, the polar bear's reign as the climate movement's mascot was coming to an end. ""The child with the inhaler or the worker in Ohio that doesn't have a job or the mom filling up her car with $4-a-gallon gas-those are more effective symbols of what the future holds if we don't have change in our energy policies,"" says Daniel J. Weiss, the director of climate strategy at the Center for American Progress. Late last year, a handful of former Iraq and Afghanistan vets established a group called Operation Free, which, with a partner group, VoteVets.org, is responsible for the most visceral climate-change ad in recent memory. Titled ""Tough,"" it features footage of American troop convoys in Iraq getting blown up by IEDs-some of which, the ad contends, are made in Iran-and then, over an image of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, an Iraq vet declares, ""Every time oil goes up one dollar, Iran gets another one-and-a-half-billion dollars to use against us.""A Marine scout sniper team leader who served two tours in Iraq, Matt Victoriano now spends many of his days driving around in Operation Free's biodiesel bus to talk about clean energy and climate change-at least until he finds out whether he's been accepted into the Special Forces. ""Mission after mission when I was in Iraq, I was guarding supply routes so that our fuel could get to our forward operating bases,"" he told a small crowd in a parking lot in Greenville, South Carolina, one recent morning. ""And it dawned on me later that we can't defeat the terrorists, we can't defend the country, and we can't protect our own citizens with our energy policy as it exists today.""""Almost everyone gets the message,"" he said earlier, as the bus rolled through Virginia. Victoriano, who is slight with dark brown eyes and speaks in clipped sentences, had four days' growth of beard and Oakleys perched atop his head. He looked less like a new environmentalist than an old sniper, and as he talked about the climate movement, he expressed frustration about some of his environmental allies. ""One guy who was working for an environmental group wanted everybody to show up and make T-shirts, paint T-shirts, and mail them to a Senate office,"" he recalled about one of the stops the Operation Free bus had made. ""No, I don't do that. It's useless."" He preferred harder-hitting messages, like the ""Tough"" ad. ""When I saw that I said, 'It's about time!' Everybody likes to pussyfoot around this shit. That ad throws it right in your face.""Some environmentalists question the wisdom of such macho posturing. Marshall Ganz, a Harvard expert on movement-building who works with some climate activists, calls the ""Tough"" ad ""awful and jingoistic."" ""Talk about shortsighted,"" he says. ""You don't achieve radical change by trying to finesse and pretend it's something it's not. It's as if instead of Dr. King saying 'Freedom now,' he'd said, 'We don't really want freedom, just a little bit, and actually it's to support America in the fight against Russia.'?""But most climate activists appear to have made their peace with the security argument. In fact, Operation Free relies on Clean Energy Works-the coalition in charge of the national lobbying campaign for the climate bill-to do much of its local organizing. ""You have people who support the more tree-hugging, polar-bear portion, and they look at us and they're like, 'Ehh, you're just military guys,'?"" Victoriano said. ""But in the end, after they listen to us talk, they go, 'Okay, yeah, this is good, this is poignant, and this is going to be more decisive than anything we can do. We need to jump on board and roll with you guys.'?""Greenpeace currently has two of its boats stationed in the gulf, along with several photographers who are there to ""bear witness and in a lot of ways behave like journalists,"" explains Molly Dorozenski, a Greenpeace staffer. (Greenpeace, for instance, takes credit for having revealed a liability waiver BP was asking its contract workers to sign.) Almost every other environmental organization is retooling its message to engage the catastrophe. VoteVets.org's latest ad features a National Guardsman assigned to clean up the BP spill who complains, ""When I signed on with the National Guard, I did it to help protect America from our enemies, like in the Persian Gulf, not to clean up an oil company's mess here, in the Gulf of Mexico."" Billy Parish, the founder of Energy Action Coalition, is working to develop a program that would allow consumers to earmark any energy savings to gulf-restoration efforts.""This is unlike any moment I can remember since I've been doing climate campaigning,"" says May Boeve of 350.org, ""where you have a really engaged public and a really engaged press presence. We often have to really pull people and the press kicking and screaming to pay attention. But right now, for each event we do for the oil spill, there's substantial interest.""Of course, the person whose interest matters most is Obama. Despite his grandiose campaign promises to do something about climate change-""This was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal,"" he proclaimed on the night he sewed up the Democratic nomination-he has spent most of his presidency pursuing what Eric Pooley, in his new book The Climate War, quotes White House aides describing as a ""stealth strategy"" on the issue, deliberately refusing to elevate it lest the president stir up the opposition. Alas, the opposition hardly needed Obama's involvement to be stirred up, and when environmentalists complained that Obama wasn't doing enough, especially in the wake of Copenhagen, it only made the White House more reticent on the issue. ""Our side did not make Copenhagen look like a win for the president,"" says one senior environmental leader. ""And if you were [David] Axelrod, you'd be like, 'Fuck them. POTUS went over there at their request and then they made them look bad.'?""The spill, however, appears to have changed Obama's political calculus. Now he's making a new push to pass comprehensive climate-and-energy legislation that's currently stalled in the Senate. ""The votes may not be there right now, but I intend to find them in the coming months,"" he said in a speech in early June. And while his prime-time address to the nation on the spill last week was not the climate-change cri de coeur many environmentalists were hoping for-indeed, he mentioned the word ""climate"" only once-the White House is at least paying the issue more prominent lip service, and shifting its place on the public agenda. ""The fact that Obama is talking about climate-and-energy legislation in a prime-time speech from the Oval Office is qualitatively different from what was happening before the spill,"" says Pooley. ""Not so long ago, these kinds of remarks were confined to afternoon events at solar factories.""If the environmental movement can't win the media game this summer-as more beaches close, more dead turtles wash onto shore, and the currents channel oil up the Eastern Seaboard-they will have missed an opportunity of a generation. They know this. But they also know (from watching the health-care debate drag on and on) that even if Obama does invest political capital on a climate-change bill that results in meaningful legislation (a big if), the fight may easily continue beyond the moment when BP eventually kills the well. Which means they have to build a real-and sustained-movement.""There are a lot of really talented lobbyists in D.C.,"" says McKibben, ""but they don't have anything to work with. Senators know there isn't that much behind them."" If this summer's BP anger is to be channeled into a fundamental rewiring of how people think about the planet, environmentalists have to get them to think about it often and in unexpected, depoliticized places. To that end, Ed Maibach at George Mason is teaming up with the nonprofit group Climate Central to invade the local TV weather forecast, which most Americans recently reported trusting for information about global warming. This is the kind of statistic that makes climate scientists crazy. As does a recent poll suggesting that almost two-thirds of all TV meteorologists think there's no scientific consensus on the subject. Still, since that's where the message is getting across, Maibach set out to shape it, enlisting a Columbia, South Carolina, weatherman named Jim Gandy as his guinea pig.Unlike some of his TV colleagues, Gandy is a believer; he was shocked a couple of years ago when a geology professor asked him if global warming was real. Next month, Gandy will begin dropping into his nightly weathercasts the first of a dozen 30-second climate-change segments he has produced with Climate Central. One will explain that while today about six June days in Columbia hit 95 degrees, the number will almost double by around 2050, ""if we keep pumping heat-trapping pollution into our atmosphere."" Another will discuss the likely increase in the number of days that hit 101 degrees by likening them to a game of craps being played with loaded dice. ""I don't live in a red state. I live in a dark-red state,"" he says. ""If you can convince these people of global warming, you can convince anybody.""Maibach hopes that within the next couple of years, the local news will be flooded with Jim Gandys, forcing viewers to integrate thinking about climate change into their daily routine. Other environmental groups are focusing on similar projects. For years, the conventional wisdom has been that making household decisions to install compact fluorescent lamps-rather than fight for political legislation-is, in the words of some critics, an ""unstrategic use of virtue."" But recent neuroscience and behavioral-economics research suggest that changing people's individual behavior may be the best way to grow a movement. To that end, the Natural Resources Defense Council recently presented what it calls a ""behavioral wedge""-a list of fifteen fairly simple and affordable actions, from taking one fewer airline flight per year to eating poultry instead of red meat two days a week, that could reduce America's greenhouse-gas emissions by 15 percent by 2020. McKibben's 350.org is organizing global ""work parties""-rather than political rallies-this October, during which people install solar panels on the roofs of their homes or dig community gardens in the neighborhoods. Later this summer, Gore's Alliance for Climate Protection is planning to launch a program called Repower at Home that will focus on helping Americans create more energy-efficient homes. ""The human brain is best attuned to deal with problems that are really close and really immediate,"" says Keith Goodman, who's in charge of the project. ""This is designed to help us get over that action hurdle. By giving people tasks that are more urgent at the household level, we can build that momentum.""A key task the project hopes to solve is the problem of public signaling. ""One reason the Prius has been so successful is because it's distinctive-looking,"" says Goodman. ""Prius owners brand themselves with it. But when you look at other things you can do, like get your home weatherized, that's totally invisible. All those peer and social effects don't happen."" Repower at Home plans to experiment with door stickers or yard flags, for example, to signal homes that have programmable thermostats. It's also building a website where people can document their own energy-efficiency efforts. The goal is to make efficiency cool. ""How do you make it aspirational?"" asks Goodman. ""We need to make people feel that unless their home is efficient, they can't even have people over for dinner.""On Thursday, June 17, John Kerry appeared before his fellow Democratic senators, who were gathered in the Capitol's Mansfield Room for a caucus meeting, to make an impassioned plea for a comprehensive climate-and-energy bill. The centerpiece of his presentation was a short video that sought to answer the question Why Now? Since it was aimed at a bunch of politicians worried about reelection, there was the requisite mention of recent polling data that seem to show public support for legislation that limits greenhouse gases. But most of Kerry's video featured the images-and corresponding messages-that environmentalists have been working so hard to associate with climate-change. There were pictures of oil-soaked birds and beaches, workers building wind turbines and installing solar panels, a kid with an inhaler, and even a brief shot of an unshaven Matt Victoriano with some other vets in Kerry's office. The video ended with a replay of the ""Tough"" ad. There was nary a polar bear to be seen.No one in Washington seems to have a handle on what Obama's Oval Office speech signaled-or how much of this new climate-change message is getting through. Although a number of pundits and even some environmentalists thought the address effectively doomed Kerry and Joe Lieberman's efforts to get the Senate to put a price on carbon-""Deadly Silence on Carbon Caps,"" read the Politico headline-supporters of a carbon cap had a different read. ""My sense has always been that the person in the White House who most wants the cap is the president,"" says an environmental lobbyist, ""which is an important player to have.""""I don't know what else people want him to do,"" says one senior Senate Democratic aide, who argues that Obama has been working hard on climate issues both publicly and privately (for instance, calling senators to lobby against an unsuccessful effort by Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski to bar the EPA from regulating greenhouse-gas emissions). On June 23, Obama will host a bi-partisan meeting of senators at the White House to discuss climate-and-energy legislation. ""He's really fighting for this stuff,"" says the Senate aide.What, exactly, is the president fighting for? Just as during the health-care debate, he's been maddeningly vague-at least in public. But behind the scenes, the road map the White House and its Senate allies appear to be devising entails drafting new climate-and-energy legislation over the next few weeks and then introducing it when the Senate returns from its Fourth of July recess. The bill would likely include new safeguards on offshore oil production and policies to reduce oil consumption, such as increasing the deployment of electric vehicles and raising efficiency standards in buildings. It probably wouldn't include a comprehensive carbon cap but, instead, would impose one just on utilities. The thinking, according to one lobbyist, is that ""the two main sources for global-warming pollution are coal-fired power plants and using oil for transportation fuel, so if the Senate adopts a cap on carbon pollution from utilities and reduces oil use through fuel economy standards, electric cars, and natural gas trucks, then that would represent some significant carbon pollution reductions."" Once the bill passes, it would go to be reconciled with the House's own climate-and-energy legislation (which does include a comprehensive carbon cap) before being sent back to both houses for a final vote, likely after the November midterm elections-when, presumably, politicians will be less nervous about the consequences of their vote.Or, conversely, the White House and the Senate could fink out and resign themselves to a so-called energy-only bill, which includes no cap on carbon. At this point, it's anybody's guess what will happen. But if the end result is an energy-only bill, says McKibben, it will show that Obama and the senators ""are afraid to deal with these things because they find them politically hard. So what we have to do is keep trying to change that political reality as much as we can."" In other words, the movement will have failed to meet the moment. And there's nothing reassuring-and actually something rather terrifying-in the knowledge that another moment will surely come again."
"9","Article 9","In February, 2003, a series of ads on the theme of inundation began appearing on Dutch TV. The ads were sponsored by the Netherlands' Ministry of Transport, Public Works, and Water Management, and they featured a celebrity weatherman named Peter Timofeeff. In one commercial, Timofeeff, who looks a bit like Albert Brooks and a bit like Gene Shalit, sat relaxing on the shore in a folding chair. ""Sea level is rising,"" he announced, as waves started creeping up the beach. He continued to sit and talk even as a boy who had been building a sandcastle abandoned it in panic. At the end of the ad, Timofeeff, still seated, was immersed in water up to his waist.In another commercial, Timofeeff was shown wearing a business suit and standing by a bathtub. ""These are our rivers,"" he explained, climbing into the tub and turning on the shower full blast. ""The climate is changing. It will rain more often, and more heavily."" Water filled the tub and spilled over the sides. It dripped through the floorboards, onto the head of his screeching wife, below. ""We should give the water more space and widen the rivers,"" he advised, reaching for a towel.Both the beach-chair and the shower ads were part of a public-service campaign that also included radio spots, newspaper announcements, and free tote bags. Notwithstanding their comic tone-other commercials showed Timofeeff trying to start a motorboat in a cow pasture and digging a duck pond in his back yard-their message was sombre.A quarter of the Netherlands lies below sea level, much of it on land wrested from either the North Sea or the Rhine or the River Meuse. Another quarter, while slightly higher, is still low enough that, in the natural course of events, it would regularly be flooded. What makes the country habitable is the world's most sophisticated water-management system, which comprises more than ten thousand miles of dikes, dams, weirs, flood barriers, and artificial dunes, not to mention countless pumps, holding ponds, and windmills. (People in Holland like to joke, ""God made the world, but the Dutch made the Netherlands."")Until recently, it was assumed that any threat to low-lying areas would be dealt with the same way such threats always had been: by raising the dikes, or by adding new ones. (The latest addition, the Maeslant barrier, which is supposed to protect Rotterdam from storm surges with the aid of two movable arms, each the size of a skyscraper, was completed in 1997.) But this is no longer the case. The very engineers who perfected the system have become convinced that it is unsustainable. After centuries of successfully manipulating nature, the Dutch, the ads warn, will have to switch course.Eelke Turkstra runs a water-ministry program called Room for the River, which is just the sort of enterprise that Timofeeff was advocating when he climbed into the bathtub. A few months ago, I arranged to speak with Turkstra, and he suggested that we meet at a nature center along a branch of the Rhine known as the Nieuwe Merwede. The center featured an exhibit about the effects of climate change. One kid-friendly display allowed visitors to turn a crank and, in effect, drown the countryside. By 2100, the display showed, the Nieuwe Merwede could be running several feet above the local dikes.From the nature center, Turkstra took me by car ferry across the river. On the other side, we drove through an area that was made up entirely of ""polders""-land that has been laboriously reclaimed from the water. The polders were shaped like ice trays, with sloping sides and perfectly flat fields along the bottom. Every once in a while, there was a sturdy-looking farmhouse. The whole scene-the level fields, the thatched barns, even the gray clouds sitting on the horizon-could have been borrowed from a painting by Hobbema. Turkstra explained that the plan of Room for the River was to buy out the farmers who were living in the polders, then lower the dikes and let the Nieuwe Merwede flood when necessary. It was expected that the project would cost three hundred and ninety million dollars. Similar projects are under way in other parts of the Netherlands, and it is likely that in the future even more drastic measures will be necessary, including, some experts argue, the construction of a whole new outlet channel for the Rhine.""Some people don't get it,"" Turkstra told me as we zipped along. ""They think this project is stupid. But I think it's stupid to continue in the old way.""A few years ago, in an article in Nature, the Dutch chemist Paul Crutzen coined a term. No longer, he wrote, should we think of ourselves as living in the Holocene, as the period since the last glaciation is known. Instead, an epoch unlike any of those which preceded it had begun. This new age was defined by one creature-man-who had become so dominant that he was capable of altering the planet on a geological scale. Crutzen, a Nobel Prize winner, dubbed this age the Anthropocene. He proposed as its starting date the seventeen-eighties, the decade in which James Watt perfected his steam engine and, inadvertently, changed the history of the earth.In the seventeen-eighties, ice-core records show, carbon-dioxide levels stood at about two hundred and eighty parts per million. Give or take ten parts per million, this was the same level that they had been at two thousand years earlier, in the era of Julius Caesar, and two thousand years before that, at the time of Stonehenge, and two thousand years before that, at the founding of the first cities. When, subsequently, industrialization began to drive up CO2 levels, they rose gradually at first-it took more than a hundred and fifty years to get to three hundred and fifteen parts per million-and then much more rapidly. By the mid-nineteen-seventies, they had reached three hundred and thirty parts per million, and, by the mid-nineteen-nineties, three hundred and sixty parts per million. Just in the past decade, they have risen by as much-twenty parts per million-as they did during the previous ten thousand years of the Holocene.For every added increment of carbon dioxide, the earth will experience a temperature rise, which represents what is called the equilibrium warming. If current trends continue, atmospheric CO2 will reach five hundred parts per million-nearly double pre-industrial levels-around the middle of the century. It is believed that the last time CO2 concentrations were that high was during the period known as the Eocene, some fifty million years ago. In the Eocene, crocodiles roamed Colorado and sea levels were nearly three hundred feet higher than they are today.For all practical purposes, the recent ""carbonation"" of the atmosphere is irreversible. Carbon dioxide is a persistent gas; it lasts for about a century. Thus, while it is possible to increase CO2 concentrations relatively quickly, by, say, burning fossil fuels or levelling forests, the opposite is not the case. The effect might be compared to driving a car equipped with an accelerator but no brakes.The long-term risks of this path are well known. Barely a month passes without a new finding on the dangers posed by rising CO2 levels-to the polar ice cap, to the survival of the world's coral reefs, to the continued existence of low-lying nations. Yet the world has barely even begun to take action. This is particularly true of the United States, which is the largest emitter of carbon dioxide by far. (The average American produces some twelve thousand pounds of CO2 emissions annually.) As we delay, the opportunity to change course is slipping away. ""We have only a few years, and not ten years but less, to do something,"" the Dutch state secretary for the environment, Pieter van Geel, told me when I went to visit him in The Hague.In climate-science circles, a future in which current emissions trends continue, unchecked, is known as ""business as usual,"" or B.A.U. A few years ago, Robert Socolow, a professor of engineering at Princeton, began to think about B.A.U. and what it implied for the fate of mankind. Socolow had recently become co-director of the Carbon Mitigation Initiative, a project funded by BP and Ford, but he still considered himself an outsider to the field of climate science. Talking to insiders, he was struck by the degree of their alarm. ""I've been involved in a number of fields where there's a lay opinion and a scientific opinion,"" he told me when I went to talk to him shortly after returning from the Netherlands. ""And, in most of the cases, it's the lay community that is more exercised, more anxious. If you take an extreme example, it would be nuclear power, where most of the people who work in nuclear science are relatively relaxed about very low levels of radiation. But, in the climate case, the experts-the people who work with the climate models every day, the people who do ice cores-they are more concerned. They're going out of their way to say, 'Wake up! This is not a good thing to be doing.' ""Socolow, who is sixty-seven, is a trim man with wire-rimmed glasses and gray, vaguely Einsteinian hair. Although by training he is a theoretical physicist-he did his doctoral research on quarks-he has spent most of his career working on problems of a more human scale, like how to prevent nuclear proliferation or construct buildings that don't leak heat. In the nineteen-seventies, Socolow helped design an energy-efficient housing development, in Twin Rivers, New Jersey. At another point, he developed a system-never commercially viable-to provide air-conditioning in the summer using ice created in the winter. When Socolow became co-director of the Carbon Mitigation Initiative, he decided that the first thing he needed to do was get a handle on the scale of the problem. He found that the existing literature on the subject offered almost too much information. In addition to B.A.U., a dozen or so alternative scenarios, known by code names like A1 and B1, had been devised; these all tended to jumble together in his mind, like so many Scrabble tiles. ""I'm pretty quantitative, but I could not remember these graphs from one day to the next,"" he recalled. He decided to try to streamline the problem, mainly so that he could understand it.There are two ways to measure carbon-dioxide emissions. One is to count the full weight of the CO2; the other, favored by the scientific community, is to count just the weight of the carbon. Using the latter measure, global emissions last year amounted to seven billion metric tons. (The United States contributed more than twenty per cent of the total, or 1.6 billion metric tons of carbon.) ""Business as usual"" yields several different estimates of future emissions: a mid-range projection is that carbon emissions will reach 10.5 billion metric tons a year by 2029, and fourteen billion tons a year by 2054. Holding emissions constant at today's levels means altering this trajectory so that fifty years from now seven billion of those fourteen billion tons of carbon aren't being poured into the atmosphere.Stabilizing CO2 emissions, Socolow realized, would be a monumental undertaking, so he decided to break the problem down into more manageable blocks, which he called ""stabilization wedges."" For simplicity's sake, he defined a stabilization wedge as a step that would be sufficient to prevent a billion metric tons of carbon per year from being emitted by 2054. Along with a Princeton colleague, Stephen Pacala, he eventually came up with fifteen different wedges-theoretically, at least eight more than would be necessary to stabilize emissions. These fall, very roughly, into three categories-wedges that deal with energy demand, wedges that deal with energy supply, and wedges that deal with ""capturing"" CO2 and storing it somewhere other than the atmosphere. Last year, the two men published their findings in a paper in Science which received a great deal of attention. The paper was at once upbeat-""Humanity already possesses the fundamental scientific, technical, and industrial know-how to solve the carbon and climate problem for the next half-century,"" it declared-and deeply sobering. ""There is no easy wedge"" is how Socolow put it to me.Consider wedge No. 11. This is the photovoltaic, or solar-power, wedge-probably the most appealing of all the alternatives, at least in the abstract. Photovoltaic cells, which have been around for more than fifty years, are already in use in all sorts of small-scale applications and in some larger ones where the cost of connecting to the electrical grid is prohibitively high. The technology, once installed, is completely emissions-free, producing no waste products, not even water. Assuming that a thousand-megawatt coal-fired power plant produces about 1.5 million tons of carbon a year-in the future, coal plants are expected to become more efficient-to get a wedge out of photovoltaics would require enough cells to produce seven hundred thousand megawatts. Since sunshine is intermittent, two million megawatts of capacity is needed to produce that much power. This, it turns out, would require PV arrays covering a surface area of five million acres-approximately the size of Connecticut.Wedge No. 10 is wind electricity. The standard output of a wind turbine is two megawatts, so to get a wedge out of wind power would require at least a million turbines. Other wedges present different challenges, some technical, some social. Nuclear power produces no carbon dioxide; instead, it generates radioactive waste, with all the attendant problems of storage, disposal, and international policing. Currently, there are four hundred and forty-one nuclear power plants in the world; one wedge would require doubling their capacity. There are also two automobile wedges. The first requires that every car in the world be driven half as much as it is today. The second requires that it be twice as efficient. (Since 1987, the fuel efficiency of passenger vehicles in the U.S. has actually declined, by more than five per cent.)Three of the possible options are based on a technology known as ""carbon capture and storage,"" or C.C.S. As the name suggests, with C.C.S. carbon dioxide is ""captured"" at the source-presumably a power plant or other large emitter. Then it is injected at very high pressure into geological formations, such as depleted oil fields, underground. No power plants actually use C.C.S. at this point, nor is it certain that CO2 injected underground will remain there permanently; the world's longest-running C.C.S. effort, maintained by the Norwegian oil company Statoil at a natural-gas field in the North Sea, has been operational for only eight years. One wedge of C.C.S. would require thirty-five hundred projects on the scale of Statoil's.In a world like today's, where there is, for the most part, no direct cost to emitting CO2, none of Socolow's wedges are apt to be implemented; this is, of course, why they represent a departure from ""business as usual."" To alter the economics against carbon requires government intervention. Countries could set a strict limit on CO2, and then let emitters buy and sell carbon ""credits."" (In the United States, this same basic strategy has been used successfully with sulfur dioxide in order to curb acid rain.) Another alternative is to levy a tax on carbon. Both of these options have been extensively studied by economists; using their work, Socolow estimates that the cost of emitting carbon would have to rise to around a hundred dollars a ton to provide a sufficient incentive to adopt many of the options he has proposed. Assuming that the cost were passed on to consumers, a hundred dollars a ton would raise the price of a kilowatt-hour of coal-generated electricity by about two cents, which would add roughly fifteen dollars a month to the average American family's electricity bill. (In the U.S., more than fifty per cent of electricity is generated by coal.)All of Socolow's calculations are based on the notion-clearly hypothetical-that steps to stabilize emissions will be taken immediately, or at least within the next few years. This assumption is key not only because we are constantly pumping more CO2 into the atmosphere but also because we are constantly building infrastructure that, in effect, guarantees that that much additional CO2 will be released in the future. In the U.S., the average new car gets about twenty miles to the gallon; if it is driven a hundred thousand miles, it will produce almost forty-three metric tons of carbon during its lifetime. A thousand-megawatt coal plant built today, meanwhile, is likely to last fifty years; if it is constructed without C.C.S. capability, it will emit some hundred million tons of carbon during its life. The overriding message of Socolow's wedges is that the longer we wait-and the more infrastructure we build without regard to its impact on emissions-the more daunting the task of keeping CO2 levels below five hundred parts per million will become. Indeed, even if we were to hold emissions steady for the next half century, Socolow's graphs show that much steeper cuts would be needed in the following half century to keep CO2 concentrations from exceeding that level. After a while, I asked Socolow whether he thought that stabilizing emissions was a politically feasible goal. He frowned.""I'm always being asked, 'What can you say about the practicability of various targets?' "" he told me. ""I really think that's the wrong question. These things can all be done.""What kind of issue is like this that we faced in the past?"" he continued. ""I think it's the kind of issue where something looked extremely difficult, and not worth it, and then people changed their minds. Take child labor. We decided we would not have child labor and goods would become more expensive. It's a changed preference system. Slavery also had some of those characteristics a hundred and fifty years ago. Some people thought it was wrong, and they made their arguments, and they didn't carry the day. And then something happened and all of a sudden it was wrong and we didn't do it anymore. And there were social costs to that. I suppose cotton was more expensive. We said, 'That's the trade-off; we don't want to do this anymore.' So we may look at this and say, 'We are tampering with the earth.' The earth is a twitchy system. It's clear from the record that it does things that we don't fully understand. And we're not going to understand them in the time period we have to make these decisions. We just know they're there. We may say, 'We just don't want to do this to ourselves.' If it's a problem like that, then asking whether it's practical or not is really not going to help very much. Whether it's practical depends on how much we give a damn.""Marty Hoffert is a professor of physics at New York University. He is big and bearish, with a wide face and silvery hair. Hoffert got his undergraduate degree in aeronautical engineering, and one of his first jobs, in the mid-nineteen-sixties, was helping to develop the U.S.'s antiballistic-missile system. Eventually, he decided that he wanted to work on something, in his words, ""more productive."" In this way, he became involved in climate research. Hoffert is primarily interested in finding new, carbon-free ways to generate energy. He calls himself a ""technological optimist,"" and a lot of his ideas about electric power have a wouldn't-it-be-cool, Buck Rogers sound to them. On other topics, though, Hoffert is a killjoy.""We have to face the quantitative nature of the challenge,"" he told me one day over lunch at the N.Y.U. faculty club. ""Right now, we're going to just burn everything up; we're going to heat the atmosphere to the temperature it was in the Cretaceous, when there were crocodiles at the poles. And then everything will collapse.""Currently, the new technology that Hoffert is pushing is space-based solar power, or S.S.P. In theory, at least, S.S.P. involves launching into space satellites equipped with massive photovoltaic arrays. Once a satellite is in orbit, the array would unfold or, according to some plans, inflate. S.S.P. has two important advantages over conventional, land-based solar power. In the first place, there is more sunlight in space-roughly eight times as much, per unit of area-and, in the second, this sunlight is constant: satellites are not affected by clouds or by nightfall. The obstacles, meanwhile, are several. No full-scale test of S.S.P. has ever been conducted. (In the nineteen-seventies, nasa studied the idea of sending a photovoltaic array the size of Manhattan into space, but the project never, as it were, got off the ground.) Then, there is the expense of launching satellites. Finally, once the satellites are up, there is the difficulty of getting the energy down. Hoffert imagines solving this last problem by using microwave beams of the sort used by cell-phone towers, only much more tightly focussed. He believes, as he put it to me, that S.S.P. has a great deal of ""long-term promise""; however, he is quick to point out that he is open to other ideas, like putting solar collectors on the moon, or using superconducting wires to transmit electricity with minimal energy loss, or generating wind power using turbines suspended in the jet stream. The important thing, he argues, is not which new technology will work but simply that some new technology be found. A few years ago, Hoffert published an influential paper in Science in which he argued that holding CO2 levels below five hundred parts per million would require a ""Herculean"" effort and probably could be accomplished only through ""revolutionary"" changes in energy production.""The idea that we already possess the 'scientific, technical, and industrial know-how to solve the carbon problem' is true in the sense that, in 1939, the technical and scientific expertise to build nuclear weapons existed,"" he told me, quoting Socolow. ""But it took the Manhattan Project to make it so.""Hoffert's primary disagreement with Socolow, which both men took pains to point out to me and also took pains to try to minimize, is over the future trajectory of CO2 emissions. For the past several decades, as the world has turned increasingly from coal to oil, natural gas, and nuclear power, emissions of CO2 per unit of energy have declined, a process known as ""decarbonization."" In the ""business as usual"" scenario that Socolow uses, it is assumed that decarbonization will continue. To assume this, however, is to ignore several emerging trends. Most of the growth in energy usage in the next few decades is due to occur in places like China and India, where supplies of coal far exceed those of oil or natural gas. (China, which has plans to build five hundred and sixty-two coal-fired plants by 2012, is expected to overtake the U.S. as the world's largest carbon emitter around 2025.) Meanwhile, global production of oil and gas is expected to start to decline-according to some experts, in twenty or thirty years, and to others by the end of this decade. Hoffert predicts that the world will start to ""recarbonize,"" a development that would make the task of stabilizing carbon dioxide that much more difficult. By his accounting, recarbonization will mean that as many as twelve wedges will be needed simply to keep CO2 emissions on the same upward trajectory they're on now. (Socolow readily acknowledges that there are plausible scenarios that would push up the number of wedges needed.) Hoffert told me that he thought the federal government should be budgeting between ten and twenty billion dollars a year for primary research into new energy sources. For comparison's sake, he pointed out that the ""Star Wars"" missile-defense program, which still hasn't yielded a workable system, has already cost the government nearly a hundred billion dollars.A commonly heard argument against acting to curb global warming is that the options now available are inadequate. To his dismay, Hoffert often finds his work being cited in support of this argument, with which, he says, he vigorously disagrees. ""I want to make it very clear,"" he told me at one point. ""We have to start working immediately to implement those elements that we know how to implement and we need to start implementing these longer-term programs. Those are not opposing ideas.""""Let me say this,"" he said at another point. ""I'm not sure we can solve the problem. I hope we can. I think we have a shot. I mean, it may be that we're not going to solve global warming, the earth is going to become an ecological disaster, and, you know, somebody will visit in a few hundred million years and find there were some intelligent beings who lived here for a while, but they just couldn't handle the transition from being hunter-gatherers to high technology. It's certainly possible. Carl Sagan had an equation-the Drake equation-for how many intelligent species there are in the galaxy. He figured it out by saying, How many stars are there, how many planets are there around these stars, what's the probability that life will evolve on a planet, what's the probability if you have life evolve of having intelligent species evolve, and, once that happens, what's the average lifetime of a technological civilization? And that last one is the most sensitive number. If the average lifetime is about a hundred years, then probably, in the whole galaxy of four hundred billion stars, there are only a few that have intelligent civilizations. If the lifetime is several million years, then the galaxy is teeming with intelligent life. It's sort of interesting to look at it that way. And we don't know. We could go either way.""In theory, at least, the world has already committed itself to addressing global warming, a commitment that dates back more than a decade. In June of 1992, the United Nations held the so-called Earth Summit, in Rio de Janeiro. There, representatives from virtually every nation on earth met to discuss the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, which had as its sweeping objective the ""stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic""-man-made-""interference with the climate system."" One of the early signatories was President George H. W. Bush, who, while in Rio, called on world leaders to translate ""the words spoken here into concrete action to protect the planet."" Three months later, Bush submitted the Framework Convention to the U.S. Senate, which approved it by unanimous consent. Ultimately, the treaty was ratified by a hundred and sixty-five countries.What ""dangerous anthropogenic interference,"" or D.A.I., consists of was not precisely defined in the Framework Convention, although there are, it is generally agreed, a number of scenarios that would fit the bill-climate change dramatic enough to destroy entire ecosystems, for instance, or severe enough to disrupt the world's food supply. The disintegration of one of the planet's remaining ice sheets is often held up as the exemplary climate disaster; were the Greenland or the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to be destroyed, sea levels around the world would rise by at least fifteen feet, inundating areas where today hundreds of millions of people live. (Were both ice sheets to disintegrate, global sea levels would rise by thirty-five feet.) It could take hundreds, perhaps even thousands, of years for either of the ice sheets to disappear entirely, but, once the disintegration was under way, it would start to feed on itself, most likely becoming irreversible. D.A.I. is understood, therefore, to refer not to the end of the process but to the very beginning, which is to say, to the point at which greenhouse-gas levels became high enough to set disaster in motion.Among the stipulations of the Framework Convention was that the parties meet regularly to assess their progress. (These meetings became known as the Conference of the Parties, or C.O.P., sessions.) As it turned out, there was hardly any progress to assess. Article 4, paragraph 2, subparagraph b of the convention instructs industrialized nations to ""aim"" to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels. By 1995, the collective emissions from these nations were still rising. (Virtually the only countries that had succeeded in returning to 1990 levels were some former members of the Soviet bloc, and this was because their economies were in free fall.) Several rounds of often bitter negotiations followed, culminating in an eleven-day session at the Kyoto International Conference Hall in December, 1997.Technically speaking, the agreement that emerged from that session is an addendum to the Framework Convention. (Its full title is the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.) For lofty exhortations, the Kyoto Protocol substitutes mandatory commitments. These commitments apply to industrialized, or so-called Annex 1, nations, a group that includes the United States, Canada, Japan, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and several countries of the erstwhile Eastern bloc. Different Annex 1 nations have slightly different obligations, based on a combination of historical and political factors. The European Union nations, for example, are supposed to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions eight per cent below 1990 levels. The U.S. has a target of seven per cent below 1990 levels, and Japan has a target of six per cent below. The treaty covers five greenhouse gases in addition to CO2-methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride-which, for the purposes of accounting, are converted into units known as ""carbon-dioxide equivalents."" Industrialized nations can meet their targets, in part, by buying and selling emissions credits and by investing in ""clean development"" projects in developing, or so-called non-Annex 1, nations. This second group includes emergent industrial powers like China and India, oil-producing states like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and nations with mostly subsistence economies, like Sudan. Non-Annex 1 nations have no obligation to reduce their emissions during the period covered by the protocol, which ends in 2012.In political terms, global warming might be thought of as the tragedy of the commons writ very, very large. The goal of stabilizing CO2 concentrations effectively turns emissions into a limited resource, which nobody owns but everybody with a book of matches has access to.Even as Kyoto was being negotiated, it was clear that the treaty was going to face stiff opposition in Washington. In July of 1997, Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, and Senator Robert Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, introduced a ""sense of the Senate"" resolution that, in effect, warned the Clinton Administration against the direction that the talks were taking. The so-called Byrd-Hagel Resolution stated that the U.S. should reject any agreement that committed it to reducing emissions unless concomitant obligations were imposed on developing countries as well. The Senate approved the resolution by a vote of 95-0, an outcome that reflected lobbying by both business and labor. Although the Clinton Administration eventually signed Kyoto, it never submitted the protocol to the Senate for ratification, citing the need for participation by ""key developing nations.""From a certain perspective, the logic behind the Byrd-Hagel Resolution is unimpeachable. Emissions controls cost money, and this cost has to be borne by somebody. If the U.S. were to agree to limit its greenhouse gases while economic competitors like China and India were not, then American companies would be put at a disadvantage. ""A treaty that requires binding commitments for reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases for the industrial countries but not developing countries will create a very damaging situation for the American economy"" is how Richard Trumka, the secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., put it when he travelled to Kyoto to lobby against the protocol. It is also true that an agreement that limits carbon emissions in some countries and not in others could result in a migration, rather than an actual reduction, of CO2 emissions. (Such a possibility is known in climate parlance as ""leakage."")From another perspective, however, the logic of Byrd-Hagel is deeply, even obscenely, self-serving. Suppose for a moment that the total anthropogenic CO2 that can be emitted into the atmosphere were a big ice-cream cake. If the aim is to keep concentrations below five hundred parts per million, then roughly half that cake has already been consumed, and, of that half, the lion's share has been polished off by the industrialized world. To insist now that all countries cut their emissions simultaneously amounts to advocating that industrialized nations be allocated most of the remaining slices, on the ground that they've already gobbled up so much. In a year, the average American produces the same greenhouse-gas emissions as four and a half Mexicans, or eighteen Indians, or ninety-nine Bangladeshis. If both the U.S. and India were to reduce their emissions proportionately, then the average Bostonian could continue indefinitely producing eighteen times as much greenhouse gases as the average Bangalorean. But why should anyone have the right to emit more than anyone else? At a climate meeting in New Delhi three years ago, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, then the Indian prime minister, told world leaders, ""Our per capita greenhouse gas emissions are only a fraction of the world average and an order of magnitude below that of many developed countries. We do not believe that the ethos of democracy can support any norm other than equal per capita rights to global environmental resources.""Outside the U.S., the decision to exempt developing nations from Kyoto's mandates was generally regarded as an adequate-if imperfect-solution. The point was to get the process started, and to persuade countries like China and India to sign on later. This ""two-world"" approach had been employed-successfully-in the nineteen-eighties to phase out chlorofluorocarbons, the chemicals responsible for depleting atmospheric ozone. Pieter van Geel, the Dutch environment secretary, who is a member of the Netherlands' center-right Christian Democratic Party, described the European outlook to me as follows: ""We cannot say, 'Well, we have our wealth, based on the use of fossil fuels for the last three hundred years, and, now that your countries are growing, you may not grow at this rate, because we have a climate-change problem.' We should show moral leadership by giving the example. That's the only way we can ask something of these other countries.""The Kyoto Protocol finally went into effect on February 16th of this year. In many cities, the event was marked by celebration; the city of Bonn hosted a reception in the Rathaus, Oxford University held an ""Entry Into Force"" banquet, and in Hong Kong there was a Kyoto prayer meeting. As it happened, that day, an exceptionally warm one in Washington, D.C., I went to speak to the Under-Secretary of State for Global Affairs, Paula Dobriansky.Dobriansky is a slight woman with shoulder-length brown hair and a vaguely anxious manner. Among her duties is explaining the Bush Administration's position on global warming to the rest of the world; in December, for example, she led the U.S. delegation to the tenth Conference of the Parties, which was held in Buenos Aires. Dobriansky began by assuring me that the Administration took the issue of climate change ""very seriously."" She went on, ""Also let me just add, because in terms of taking it seriously, not only stating to you that we take it seriously, we have engaged many countries in initiatives and efforts, whether they are bilateral initiatives-we have some fourteen bilateral initiatives-and in addition we have put together some multilateral initiatives. So we view this as a serious issue.""Besides the U.S., the only other major industrialized nation that has rejected Kyoto-and, with it, mandatory cuts in emissions-is Australia. I asked Dobriansky how she justified the U.S.'s stance to its allies. ""We have a common goal and objective as parties to the U. N. Framework Convention on Climate Change,"" she told me. ""Where we differ is on what approach we believe is and can be the most effective.""Running for President in 2000, George W. Bush called global warming ""an issue that we need to take very seriously."" He promised, if elected, to impose federal limits on CO2. Soon after his inauguration, he sent the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Christine Todd Whitman, to a meeting of environment ministers from the world's leading industrialized nations, where she elaborated on his position. Whitman assured her colleagues that the new President believed global warming to be ""one of the greatest environmental challenges that we face"" and that he wanted to ""take steps to move forward."" Ten days after her presentation, Bush announced that not only was he withdrawing the U.S. from the ongoing negotiations over Kyoto-the protocol had left several complex issues of implementation to be resolved later-he was now opposed to any mandatory curbs on carbon dioxide. Explaining his change of heart, Bush asserted that he no longer believed that CO2 limits were justified, owing to the ""state of scientific knowledge of the causes of, and solutions to, global climate change,"" which he labelled ""incomplete."" (Former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, who backed the President's original position, has speculated publicly that the reversal was engineered by Vice-President Dick Cheney.)The following year, President Bush came forward with the Administration's current position on global warming. Central to this policy is a reworking of the key categories. Whereas Kyoto and the original Framework Convention aim at controlling greenhouse-gas emissions, the President's policy targets greenhouse-gas ""intensity."" Bush has declared his approach preferable because it recognizes ""that a nation that grows its economy is a nation that can afford investments and new technology.""Greenhouse-gas intensity is not a quantity that can be measured directly. Rather, it is a ratio that relates emissions to economic output. Say, for example, that one year a business produces a hundred pounds of carbon and a hundred dollars' worth of goods. Its greenhouse-gas intensity in that case would be one pound per dollar. If the next year that company produces the same amount of carbon but an extra dollar's worth of goods, its intensity will have fallen by one per cent. Even if it doubles its total emissions of carbon, a company-or a country-can still claim a reduced intensity provided that it more than doubles its output of goods. (Typically, a country's greenhouse-gas intensity is measured in terms of tons of carbon per million dollars' worth of gross domestic product.)To focus on greenhouse-gas intensity is to give a peculiarly sunny account of the United States' situation. Between 1990 and 2000, the U.S.'s greenhouse-gas intensity fell by some seventeen per cent, owing to several factors, including the shift toward a more service-based economy. Meanwhile, over-all emissions rose by some twelve per cent. (In terms of greenhouse-gas intensity, the U.S. actually performs better than many Third World nations, because even though we consume a lot more energy, we also have a much larger G.D.P.) In February of 2002, President Bush set the goal of reducing the country's greenhouse-gas intensity by eighteen per cent over the following ten years. During that same decade, the Administration expects the American economy to grow by three per cent annually. If both expectations are met, over-all emission of greenhouse gases will rise by about twelve per cent.The Administration's plan, which relies almost entirely on voluntary measures, has been characterized by critics as nothing more than a subterfuge-""a total charade"" is how Philip Clapp, the president of the Washington-based National Environmental Trust, once put it. Certainly, if the goal is to prevent ""dangerous anthropogenic interference,"" then greenhouse-gas intensity is the wrong measure to use. (Essentially, the President's approach amounts to following the path of ""business as usual."") The Administration's response to such criticism is to attack its premise. ""Science tells us that we cannot say with any certainty what constitutes a dangerous level of warming and therefore what level must be avoided,"" Dobriansky declared recently. When I asked her how, in that case, the U.S. could support the U.N. Framework Convention's aim of averting D.A.I., she answered by saying-twice-""We predicate our policies on sound science.""Earlier this year, the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, James Inhofe, gave a speech on the Senate floor, which he entitled ""An Update on the Science of Climate Change."" In the speech, Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, announced that ""new evidence"" had come to light that ""makes a mockery"" of the notion that human-induced warming is occurring. The Senator, who has called global warming ""the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people,"" went on to argue that this important new evidence was being suppressed by ""alarmists"" who view anthropogenic warming as ""an article of religious faith."" One of the authorities that Inhofe repeatedly cited in support of his claims was the fiction writer Michael Crichton.It was an American scientist, Charles David Keeling, who, in the nineteen-fifties, developed the technology to measure CO2 levels precisely, and it was American researchers who, working out of Hawaii's Mauna Loa Observatory, first showed that these levels were steadily rising. In the half century since then, the U.S. has contributed more than any other nation to the advancement of climate science, both theoretically, through the work of climate modellers, and experimentally, through field studies conducted on every continent.At the same time, the U.S. is also the world's chief purveyor of the work of so-called global-warming ""skeptics."" The ideas of these skeptics are published in books with titles like ""The Satanic Gases"" and ""Global Warming and Other Eco-Myths"" and then circulated on the Web by groups like Tech Central Station, which is sponsored by, among others, ExxonMobil and General Motors. While some skeptics' organizations argue that global warming isn't real, or at least hasn't been proved-""Predicting weather conditions a day or two in advance is hard enough, so just imagine how hard it is to forecast what our climate will be,"" Americans for Balanced Energy Choices, a lobbying organization funded by mining and power companies, declares on its Web site-others maintain that rising CO2 levels are actually cause for celebration.""Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion are beneficial to life on earth,"" the Greening Earth Society, an organization created by the Western Fuels Association, a utility group, states. Atmospheric levels of seven hundred and fifty parts per million-nearly triple pre-industrial levels-are nothing to worry about, the society maintains, because plants like lots of CO2, which they need for photosynthesis. (Research on this topic, the group's Web site acknowledges, has been ""frequently denigrated,"" but ""it's exciting stuff"" and provides an ""antidote to gloom-and-doom about potential changes in earth's climate."")In legitimate scientific circles, it is virtually impossible to find evidence of disagreement over the fundamentals of global warming. This fact was neatly demonstrated last year by Naomi Oreskes, a professor of history and science studies at the University of California at San Diego. Oreskes conducted a study of the more than nine hundred articles on climate change published in refereed journals between 1993 and 2003 and subsequently made available on a leading research database. Of these, she found that seventy-five per cent endorsed the view that anthropogenic emissions were responsible for at least some of the observed warming of the past fifty years. The remaining twenty-five per cent, which dealt with questions of methodology or climate history, took no position on current conditions. Not a single article disputed the premise that anthropogenic warming is under way.Still, pronouncements by groups like the Greening Earth Society and politicians like Senator Inhofe help to shape public discourse on climate change in this country. And this is clearly their point. A few years ago, the pollster Frank Luntz prepared a strategy memo for Republican members of Congress, coaching them on how to deal with a variety of environmental issues. (Luntz, who first made a name for himself by helping to craft Newt Gingrich's ""Contract with America,"" has been described as ""a political consultant viewed by Republicans as King Arthur viewed Merlin."") Under the heading ""Winning the Global Warming Debate,"" Luntz wrote, ""The scientific debate is closing (against us) but not yet closed. There is still a window of opportunity to challenge the science."" He warned, ""Voters believe that there is no consensus about global warming in the scientific community. Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly."" Luntz also advised, ""The most important principle in any discussion of global warming is your commitment to sound science.""It is in this context, and really only in this context, that the Bush Administration's conflicting claims about the science of global warming make any sense. Administration officials are quick to point to the scientific uncertainties that remain about global warming, of which there are many. But where there is broad scientific agreement they are reluctant to acknowledge it. ""When we make decisions, we want to make sure we do so on sound science,"" the President said, announcing his new approach to global warming in February, 2002. Just a few months later, the Environmental Protection Agency delivered a two-hundred-and-sixty-three-page report to the U.N. which stated that ""continuing growth in greenhouse gas emissions is likely to lead to annual average warming over the United States that could be as much as several degrees Celsius (roughly 3 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit) during the 21st century."" The President dismissed the report-the product of years of work by federal researchers-as something ""put out by the bureaucracy."" The following spring, the E.P.A. made another effort to give an objective summary of climate science, in a report on the state of the environment. The White House interfered so insistently in the writing of the global-warming section-at one point, it tried to insert excerpts from a study partly financed by the American Petroleum Institute-that, in an internal memo, agency staff members complained that the section ""no longer accurately represents scientific consensus."" (When the E.P.A. finally published the report, the climate-science section was missing entirely.) Just two months ago, a top official with the federal Climate Change Science Program announced that he was resigning, owing to differences with the White House. The official, Rick Piltz, said that he was disturbed that the Administration insisted on vetting climate-science reports, ""rather than asking independent scientists to write them and let the chips fall where they may.""The day after the Kyoto Protocol took effect, I went to the United Nations to attend a conference entitled, appositely, ""One Day After Kyoto."" The conference, whose subtitle was ""Next Steps on Climate,"" was held in a large room with banks of curved desks, each equipped with a little plastic earpiece. The speakers included scientists, insurance-industry executives, and diplomats from all over the world, among them the U.N. Ambassador from the tiny Pacific island nation of Tuvalu, who described how his country was in danger of simply disappearing. Britain's permanent representative to the U.N., Sir Emyr Jones Parry, began his remarks to the crowd of two hundred or so by stating, ""We can't go on as we are.""When the U.S. withdrew from negotiations over Kyoto, in 2001, the entire effort nearly collapsed. According to the protocol's elaborate ratification mechanism, in order to take effect it had to be approved by countries responsible for at least fifty-five per cent of the industrialized world's CO2 emissions. All on its own, America accounts for thirty-four per cent of those emissions. European leaders spent more than three years working behind the scenes, lining up support from the remaining industrialized nations. The crucial threshold was finally crossed this past October, when the Russian Duma voted in favor of ratification. The Duma's vote was understood to be a condition of European backing for Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organization. (""russia forced to ratify kyoto protocol to become w.t.o. member,"" read the headline in Pravda.)As speaker after speaker at the U.N. conference noted, Kyoto is only the first step in a long process. Even if every country-including the U.S.-were to fulfill its obligations under the protocol before it lapses in 2012, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere would still reach dangerous levels. Kyoto merely delays this outcome. The ""next step on climate"" requires, among other things, substantive commitments from countries like China and India. So long as U.S. emissions continue to grow, essentially unchecked, obtaining these commitments seems next to impossible. In this way, the U.S., having failed to defeat Kyoto, may be in the process of doing something even more damaging: ruining the chances of reaching a post-Kyoto agreement. ""The blunt reality is that, unless America comes back into some form of international consensus, it is very hard to make progress"" is how Britain's Prime Minister, Tony Blair, diplomatically put it at a recent press conference.Astonishingly, standing in the way of progress seems to be Bush's goal. Paula Dobriansky explained the Administration's position to me as follows: While the rest of the industrialized world is pursuing one strategy (emissions limits), the U.S. is pursuing another (no emissions limits), and it is still too early to say which approach will work best. ""It is essential to really implement these programs and approaches now and to take stock of their effectiveness,"" she said, adding, ""We think it is premature to talk about future arrangements."" At C.O.P.-10, in Buenos Aires, many delegations pressed for a preliminary round of meetings so that work could start on mapping out Kyoto's successor. The U.S. delegation opposed these efforts so adamantly that finally the Americans were asked to describe, in writing, what sort of meeting they would find acceptable. They issued half a page of conditions, one of which was that the session ""shall be a one-time event held during a single day."" Another condition was, paradoxically, that, if they were going to discuss the future, the future would have to be barred from discussion; presentations, they wrote, should be limited to ""an information exchange"" on ""existing national policies."" Annie Petsonk, a lawyer with the advocacy group Environmental Defense, who previously worked for the Administration of George Bush, Sr., attended the talks in Buenos Aires. She recalled the effect that the memo had on the members of the other delegations: ""They were ashen.""European leaders have made no secret of their dismay at the Administration's stance. ""It's absolutely obvious that global warming has started,"" France's President, Jacques Chirac, said after attending last year's G-8 summit with Bush. ""And so we have to act responsibly, and, if we do nothing, we would bear a heavy responsibility. I had the chance to talk to the United States President about this. To tell you that I convinced him would be a total exaggeration, as you can imagine."" Blair, who currently holds the presidency of the G-8, recently warned that only ""timely action"" on climate change will avert ""disaster."" He has promised to make the issue one of the top items on the agenda of this year's summit, to be held in Scotland in July, but no one seems to be expecting a great deal to come of it. While attending a meeting in London this spring, the head of the White House Council on Environmental Quality, James Connaughton, announced that he wasn't yet convinced that anthropogenic warming was a problem. ""We are still working on the issue of causation, the extent to which humans are a factor,"" he said.The town of Maasbommel, sixty miles southeast of Amsterdam, is a popular tourist destination along the banks of the River Meuse. Every summer, it is visited by thousands of people who come to go boating and camping. Thanks to the risk of flooding, building is restricted along the river, but a few years ago one of the Netherlands' largest construction firms, Dura Vermeer, received permission to turn a former R.V. park into a development of ""amphibious homes."" The first of these were completed last fall, and a few months later I went to see them.The amphibious homes all look alike. They are tall and narrow, with flat sides and curved metal roofs, so that, standing next to one another, they resemble a row of toasters. Each one is moored to a metal pole and sits on a set of hollow concrete pontoons. Assuming that all goes according to plan, when the Meuse floods the homes will bob up and then, when the water recedes, they will gently be deposited back on land. Dura Vermeer is also working to construct buoyant roads and floating greenhouses. While each of these projects represents a somewhat different engineering challenge, they have a common goal, which is to allow people to continue to inhabit areas that, periodically at least, will be inundated. The Dutch, because of their peculiar vulnerability, can't afford to misjudge climate change, or to pretend that by denying it they can make it go away. ""There is a flood market emerging,"" Chris Zevenbergen, Dura Vermeer's environmental director, told me. Half a dozen families were already occupying their amphibious homes when I visited Maasbommel. Anna van der Molen, a nurse and mother of four, gave me a tour of hers. She said that she expected that in the future people all over the world would live in floating houses, since, as she put it, ""the water is coming up.""Resourcefulness and adaptability are, of course, essential human qualities. People are always imagining new ways to live, and then figuring out ways to remake the world to suit what they've imagined. This capacity has allowed us, collectively, to overcome any number of threats in the past, some imposed by nature, some by ourselves. It could be argued, taking this long view, that global warming is just one more test in a sequence that already stretches from plague and pestilence to the prospect of nuclear annihilation. If, at this moment, the bind that we're in appears insoluble, once we've thought long and hard enough about it we'll find-or maybe float-our way clear.But it's also possible to take an even longer view of the situation. We now have detailed climate records going back four full glacial cycles. What these records show, in addition to a clear correlation between CO2 levels and global temperatures, is that the last glaciation was a period of frequent and traumatic climate swings. During that period, which lasted nearly a hundred thousand years, humans who were, genetically speaking, just like ourselves wandered the globe, producing nothing more permanent than isolated cave paintings and large piles of mastodon bones. Then, ten thousand years ago, at the start of the Holocene, the climate changed. As the weather settled down, so did we. People built villages, towns, and, finally, cities, along the way inventing all the basic technologies-agriculture, metallurgy, writing-that future civilizations would rely upon. These developments would not have been possible without human ingenuity, but, until the climate cooperated, ingenuity, it seems, wasn't enough.Climate records also show that we are steadily drawing closer to the temperature peaks of the last interglacial, when sea levels were some fifteen feet higher than they are today. Just a few degrees more and the earth will be hotter than it has been at any time since our species evolved. Scientists have identified a number of important feedbacks in the climate system, many of which are not fully understood; in general, they tend to take small changes to the system and amplify them into much larger forces. Perhaps we are the most unpredictable feedback of all. No matter what we do at this point, global temperatures will continue to rise in the coming decades, owing to the gigatons of extra CO2 already circulating in the atmosphere. With more than six billion people on the planet, the risks of this are obvious. A disruption in monsoon patterns, a shift in ocean currents, a major drought-any one of these could easily produce streams of refugees numbering in the millions. As the effects of global warming become more and more apparent, will we react by finally fashioning a global response? Or will we retreat into ever narrower and more destructive forms of self-interest? It may seem impossible to imagine that a technologically advanced society could choose, in essence, to destroy itself, but that is what we are now in the process of doing."
"10","Article 10","The science of  is more solid and widely agreed upon than you might think. But the scope of the topic, as well as rampant disinformation, can make it hard to separate fact from fiction. Here, we’ve done our best to present you with not only the most accurate scientific information, but also an explanation of how we know it.How do we know climate change is really happening?is often cast as a prediction made by complicated computer models. But the scientific basis for climate change is much broader, and models are actually only one part of it (and, for what it’s worth, they’re ).For , scientists have understood the basic physics behind why greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide cause warming. These gases make up just a small fraction of the atmosphere but exert outsized control on Earth’s climate by trapping some of the planet’s heat before it escapes into space. This greenhouse effect is important: It’s why a planet so far from the sun has liquid water and life!However, during the Industrial Revolution, people started burning coal and other fossil fuels to power factories, smelters and steam engines, which added more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Ever since, human activities have been heating the planet.We know this is true thanks to an overwhelming body of evidence that begins with temperature measurements taken at weather stations and on ships starting in the mid-1800s. Later, scientists began tracking surface temperatures with satellites and looking for clues about climate change in geologic records. Together, these data all tell the same story: Earth is getting hotter.Average global temperatures have increased by 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1.2 degrees Celsius, since 1880, with the greatest changes happening in the late 20th century. Land areas have warmed more than the sea surface and the Arctic has warmed the most — by more than 4 degrees Fahrenheit just since the 1960s. Temperature extremes have also shifted. In the United States, daily record highs now outnumber record lows two-to-one.This warming is unprecedented in recent geologic history. A famous illustration,  and often called the hockey-stick graph, shows how temperatures remained fairly flat for centuries (the shaft of the stick) before turning sharply upward (the blade). It’s based on data from tree rings, ice cores and other natural indicators. And the , which has withstood decades of scrutiny from climate scientists and contrarians alike, shows that Earth is hotter today than it’s been in at least 1,000 years, and probably much longer.In fact, surface temperatures actually mask the true scale of climate change, because the . Measurements collected over the last six decades by oceanographic expeditions and networks of floating instruments show that every layer of the ocean is warming up. According to , the ocean has absorbed as much heat between 1997 and 2015 as it did in the previous 130 years.We also know that climate change is happening because we see the effects everywhere. Ice sheets and glaciers are shrinking while sea levels are rising. Arctic sea ice is disappearing. In the spring, snow melts sooner and plants flower earlier. Animals are moving to higher elevations and latitudes to find cooler conditions. And droughts, floods and  have all gotten more extreme. Models predicted many of these changes, but observations show they are now coming to pass..How much agreement is there among scientists about climate change?There’s no denying that scientists love a good, old-fashioned argument. But when it comes to climate change, there is virtually no debate:  have found that more than 90 percent of scientists who study Earth’s climate agree that the planet is warming and that humans are the primary cause. Most major scientific bodies, from  to the , endorse this view. That’s an astounding level of consensus given the contrarian, competitive nature of the scientific enterprise, where questions like what killed the dinosaurs remain .Scientific agreement about climate change started to emerge in the late 1980s, when the influence of human-caused warming began to rise above natural climate variability. By 1991, two-thirds of earth and atmospheric scientists surveyed for an early consensus study said that they accepted the idea of anthropogenic global warming. And by 1995, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a famously conservative body that periodically takes stock of the state of scientific knowledge,  “the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate.” Currently, more than  agree on the existence and cause of climate change (as does nearly  of the United States).So where did we get the idea that there’s still debate about climate change? A lot of it came from  by companies and politicians that opposed climate action. Many pushed the narrative that scientists still hadn’t made up their minds about climate change, even though that was misleading. Frank Luntz, a Republican consultant, explained the rationale in an infamous  to conservative lawmakers: “Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly,” he wrote. Questioning consensus remains a common talking point today, and the 97 percent figure has become something of a .To bolster the falsehood of lingering scientific doubt, some people have pointed to things like the Global Warming Petition Project, which urged the United States government to reject the Kyoto Protocol of 1997, an early international climate agreement. The petition proclaimed that climate change wasn’t happening, and even if it were, it wouldn’t be bad for humanity. Since 1998, more than 30,000 people with science degrees have signed it. However, nearly 90 percent of them studied something other than Earth, atmospheric or environmental science, and the signatories included just 39 climatologists. Most were engineers, doctors, and others whose training had little to do with the physics of the climate system.A few well-known researchers remain opposed to the scientific consensus. Some, like Willie Soon, a researcher affiliated with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, have . Others do not, but their assertions have  under the weight of evidence. At least one prominent skeptic, the physicist Richard Muller, changed his mind after reassessing historical temperature data as part of the  project. His team’s findings essentially confirmed the results he had set out to investigate, and he came away firmly convinced that human activities were warming the planet. “Call me a converted skeptic,” he wrote  for the Times in 2012.Mr. Luntz, the Republican pollster, has also  on climate change and now advises politicians on how to motivate climate action.A final note on uncertainty: Denialists often use it as evidence that climate science isn’t settled. However, in science, uncertainty doesn’t imply a lack of knowledge. Rather, it’s a measure of how well something is known. In the case of climate change, scientists have found a range of possible future changes in temperature, precipitation and other important variables — which will depend largely on how quickly we reduce emissions. But uncertainty does not undermine their confidence that climate change is real and that people are causing it..Do we really only have 150 years of climate data? How is that enough to tell us about centuries of change?Earth’s climate is inherently variable. Some years are hot and others are cold, some decades bring more hurricanes than others, some ancient droughts spanned the better part of centuries. Glacial cycles operate over many millenniums. So how can scientists look at data collected over a relatively short period of time and conclude that humans are warming the planet? The answer is that the instrumental temperature data that we have tells us a lot, but it’s not all we have to go on.Historical records stretch back to the 1880s (and often before), when people began to regularly measure temperatures at weather stations and on ships as they traversed the world’s oceans. These data show a clear warming trend during the 20th century.Some have questioned whether these records could be skewed, for instance, by the fact that a disproportionate number of weather stations are near cities, which tend to be hotter than surrounding areas as a result of the so-called urban heat island effect. However, researchers regularly  when reconstructing global temperatures. In addition, warming is corroborated by independent data like satellite observations, which cover the whole planet, and  of measuring temperature changes.Much has also been made of the small dips and pauses that punctuate the rising temperature trend of the last 150 years. But these are just the result of natural climate variability or other human activities that temporarily counteract greenhouse warming. For instance, in the mid-1900s, internal climate dynamics and light-blocking pollution from coal-fired power plants halted global warming for a few decades. (Eventually, rising greenhouse gases and pollution-control laws caused the planet to start heating up again.) Likewise, the so-called warming hiatus of the 2000s was partly a result of natural climate variability that allowed  rather than warm the atmosphere. The years since .Still, could the entire 20th century just be one big natural climate wiggle? To address that question, we can look at other kinds of data that give a longer perspective. Researchers have used geologic records like tree rings, ice cores, corals and sediments that preserve information about prehistoric climates to extend the climate record. The resulting picture of global temperature change is basically flat for centuries, then turns sharply upward over the last 150 years. It has been a target of climate denialists for decades. However, study after study has confirmed , which show that the planet hasn’t been this hot in at least 1,000 years, and probably longer..How do we know climate change is caused by humans?Scientists have studied past climate changes to understand the factors that can cause the planet to warm or cool. The big ones are changes in solar energy, ocean circulation, volcanic activity and the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And they have each played a role at times.For example, 300 years ago, a combination of reduced solar output and increased volcanic activity cooled parts of the planet enough that Londoners regularly . About 12,000 years ago, major changes in Atlantic circulation plunged the Northern Hemisphere into a frigid state. And 56 million years ago, a giant burst of greenhouse gases, from volcanic activity or vast deposits of methane (or both), abruptly  by at least 9 degrees Fahrenheit, scrambling the climate, choking the oceans and triggering mass extinctions.In trying to determine the cause of current climate changes, . The first three have varied a bit over the last few centuries and they have quite likely had , particularly before 1950. But they cannot account for the planet’s rapidly rising temperature, especially in the second half of the 20th century, when solar output  and volcanic eruptions exerted a cooling effect.That warming . Greenhouse gases have a powerful effect on climate (see the next question for why). And since the Industrial Revolution, humans have been adding more of them to the atmosphere, primarily by extracting and burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas, which releases carbon dioxide.Bubbles of ancient air  show that, before about 1750, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was roughly 280 parts per million. It began to rise slowly and crossed the 300 p.p.m. threshold around 1900. CO2 levels then accelerated as cars and electricity became big parts of modern life, recently topping . The concentration of methane, the second most important greenhouse gas, has more than doubled. We’re now emitting carbon .These rapid increases in greenhouse gases have caused the climate to warm abruptly. In fact, climate models suggest that greenhouse warming can explain virtually all of the temperature change since 1950. According to the  by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which assesses published scientific literature, natural drivers and internal climate variability can only explain a small fraction of late-20th century warming.Another study put it this way: The odds of current warming occurring without anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are less than .But greenhouse gases aren’t the only climate-altering compounds people put into the air. Burning fossil fuels also produces particulate pollution that  and cools the planet. Scientists estimate that this pollution has masked  of the greenhouse warming we would have otherwise experienced..Since greenhouse gases occur naturally, how do we know they’re causing Earth’s temperature to rise?Greenhouse gases like water vapor and carbon dioxide serve an important role in the climate. Without them, Earth would be far too cold to maintain liquid water and humans would not exist!Here’s how it works: the planet’s temperature is basically a function of the energy the Earth absorbs from the sun (which heats it up) and the energy Earth emits to space as infrared radiation (which cools it down). Because of their molecular structure, greenhouse gases temporarily absorb some of that outgoing infrared radiation and then re-emit it in all directions, sending some of that energy back toward the surface and . Scientists .Greenhouse gas concentrations have varied naturally in the past. Over millions of years, atmospheric CO2 levels have changed depending on how much of the gas volcanoes belched into the air and how much got removed through geologic processes. On time scales of hundreds to thousands of years, concentrations have changed as carbon has cycled between the ocean, soil and air.Today, however, we are the ones causing CO2 levels to increase at  by taking ancient carbon from geologic deposits of fossil fuels and putting it into the atmosphere when we burn them. Since 1750, carbon dioxide concentrations have increased by almost 50 percent. Methane and nitrous oxide, other important anthropogenic greenhouse gases that are released mainly by agricultural activities, have also spiked over the last 250 years.We know based on the physics described above that this should cause the climate to warm. We also see certain telltale “fingerprints” of greenhouse warming. For example,  because greenhouse gases don’t go away when the sun sets. And upper layers of the atmosphere have actually cooled, because more energy is being trapped by greenhouse gases in the lower atmosphere.We also know that we are the cause of rising greenhouse gas concentrations — and not just because we can measure the CO2 coming out of tailpipes and smokestacks. We can see it in the chemical signature of the carbon in CO2.Carbon comes in three different masses: 12, 13 and 14. Things made of organic matter (including fossil fuels) tend to have relatively less carbon-13. Volcanoes tend to produce CO2 with relatively more carbon-13. And over the last century, the carbon in atmospheric CO2 has gotten lighter, pointing to an organic source.We can tell it’s old organic matter by looking for carbon-14, which is radioactive and decays over time. Fossil fuels are too ancient to have any carbon-14 left in them, so if they were behind rising CO2 levels, you would expect the amount of carbon-14 in the atmosphere to drop, which is .It’s important to note that water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. However, it does not cause warming; instead . That’s because warmer air holds more moisture, which creates a snowball effect in which human-caused warming allows the atmosphere to hold more water vapor and further amplifies climate change. This so-called feedback cycle has doubled the warming caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions..Why should we be worried that the planet has warmed 2°F since the 1800s?A common source of confusion when it comes to climate change is the difference between weather and climate. Weather is the constantly changing set of meteorological conditions that we experience when we step outside, whereas climate is the long-term average of those conditions, usually calculated over a 30-year period. Or, as some say: Weather is your mood and climate is your personality.So while 2 degrees Fahrenheit doesn’t represent a big change in the weather, it’s a huge change in climate. As we’ve already seen, it’s enough to melt ice and raise sea levels, to shift rainfall patterns around the world and to reorganize ecosystems, sending  toward cooler habitats and  by the millions.It’s also important to remember that two degrees represents the global average, and many parts of the world have already warmed by more than that. For example, land areas have warmed about twice as much as the sea surface. And the Arctic has warmed by about 5 degrees. That’s because the loss of snow and ice at high latitudes allows the ground to absorb more energy, causing  on top of greenhouse warming.Relatively small long-term changes in climate averages also shift extremes in significant ways. For instance, heat waves have always happened, but they have shattered records in recent years. In June of 2020, a town in Siberia registered temperatures of . And in Australia, meteorologists have  to their weather maps to show areas where temperatures exceed 125 degrees. Rising sea levels have also  because of storm surges and high tides. These are the foreshocks of climate change.And we are in for more changes in the future — up to 9 degrees Fahrenheit of average global warming by the end of the century, in the . For reference, the difference in global average temperatures between now and the peak of the last ice age, when ice sheets covered large parts of North America and Europe, is about  Fahrenheit.Under the Paris Climate Agreement, which President Biden recently rejoined, countries have agreed to try to limit total warming to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 and 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, since preindustrial times. And even this narrow range has . According to scientific studies, the difference between 2.7 and 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit will very likely mean the difference between coral reefs hanging on or going extinct, and between summer sea ice persisting in the Arctic or disappearing completely. It will also determine how many millions of people suffer from water scarcity and crop failures, and how many are driven from their homes by rising seas. In other words, one degree Fahrenheit makes a world of difference..Is climate change a part of the planet’s natural warming and cooling cycles?Earth’s climate has always changed. Hundreds of millions of years ago, the entire . Fifty million years ago, . And for the last 2.6 million years, the planet has cycled between ice ages when the planet was up to 11 degrees cooler and ice sheets covered much of North America and Europe, and milder interglacial periods like the one we’re in now.Climate denialists often point to these natural climate changes as a way to cast doubt on the idea that humans are causing climate to change today. However, that argument rests on a logical fallacy. It’s like “seeing a murdered body and concluding that people have died of natural causes in the past, so the murder victim must also have died of natural causes,” a team of social scientists wrote in , which explains the misinformation strategies behind many climate myths.Indeed, we know that different mechanisms caused the climate to change in the past. Glacial cycles, for example, were triggered by , which take place over tens of thousands of years and change how solar energy gets distributed around the globe and across the seasons.These orbital variations don’t affect the planet’s temperature much on their own. But they set off a cascade of other changes in the climate system; for instance, growing or melting vast Northern Hemisphere ice sheets and altering ocean circulation. These changes, in turn, affect climate by altering the amount of snow and ice, which reflect sunlight, and by changing greenhouse gas concentrations. This is actually part of how we know that greenhouse gases have the ability to significantly affect Earth’s temperature.For at least the last , atmospheric CO2 concentrations oscillated between about 180 parts per million during ice ages and about 280 p.p.m. during warmer periods, as carbon moved between oceans, forests, soils and the atmosphere. These changes occurred  with global temperatures, and are a major reason the entire planet warmed and cooled during glacial cycles, not just the frozen poles.Today, however, CO2 levels have soared to 420 p.p.m. — the highest they’ve been in at least . The concentration of CO2 is also increasing about  than it did at the end of the last ice age. This suggests something else is going on, and we know what it is: Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have been burning fossil fuels and releasing greenhouse gases that are heating the planet now (see  for more details on how we know this, and  and  for how we know that other natural forces aren’t to blame).Over the next century or two, societies and ecosystems will experience the consequences of this climate change. But our emissions will have even more lasting geologic impacts: According to some studies, greenhouse gas levels may have already warmed the planet enough to  for at least an additional 50,000 years.How do we know global warming is not because of the sun or volcanoes?The sun is the ultimate source of energy in Earth’s climate system, so it’s a natural candidate for causing climate change. And solar activity has certainly changed over time. We know from satellite measurements and other astronomical observations that the sun’s output changes on 11-year cycles. Geologic records and sunspot numbers, which astronomers have tracked for centuries, also show long-term variations in the sun’s activity, including some exceptionally quiet periods in the late 1600s and early 1800s.We know that, from 1900 until the 1950s, solar irradiance increased. And studies suggest that this had a modest effect on early 20th century climate,  of the warming that’s occurred since the late 1800s. However, in the second half of the century, when the most warming occurred, . This disparity is one of the main reasons we know that the sun is not the driving force behind climate change.Another reason we know that solar activity hasn’t caused recent warming is that, if it had, all the layers of the atmosphere should be heating up. Instead, data show that the upper atmosphere has actually cooled in recent decades — a hallmark of .So how about volcanoes? Eruptions cool the planet by injecting  into the atmosphere that reflect sunlight. We’ve  in the years following large eruptions. There are also some notable historical examples, like when Iceland’s Laki volcano erupted in 1783, causing widespread crop failures in Europe and beyond, and the “,” which followed the 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia.Since volcanoes mainly act as climate coolers, they can’t really explain recent warming. However, scientists say that they may also have  to rising temperatures in the early 20th century. That’s because there were several large eruptions in the late 1800s that cooled the planet, followed by a few decades with no major volcanic events when warming caught up. During the second half of the 20th century, though, several big eruptions occurred as the planet was heating up fast. If anything, they temporarily masked some amount of human-caused warming.The second way volcanoes can impact climate is by emitting carbon dioxide. This is important on time scales of millions of years — it’s what keeps the planet habitable (see  for more on the greenhouse effect). But by comparison to modern anthropogenic emissions, even big eruptions like Krakatoa and Mount St. Helens are just a drop in the bucket. After all, they last only a few hours or days, while we burn fossil fuels 24-7. Studies suggest that, today, volcanoes account for  of total CO2 emissions..How can winters and certain places be getting colder if the planet is warming?When a big snowstorm hits the United States, climate denialists can try to cite it as proof that climate change isn’t happening. In 2015, Senator James Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, famously  in the Senate as he denounced climate science. But these events don’t actually disprove climate change.While there have been some memorable storms in recent years, winters are actually warming across the world. In the United States, average temperatures in December, January and February have increased by about 2.5 degrees this century.On the flip side, record cold days are becoming less common than record warm days. In the United States, record highs now outnumber record lows . And ever-smaller areas of the country experience . (The same trends are happening globally.)So what’s with the blizzards? Weather always varies, so it’s no surprise that we still have severe winter storms even as average temperatures rise. However, some studies suggest that climate change may be to blame. One possibility is that rapid Arctic warming has affected atmospheric circulation, including the fast-flowing, high-altitude air that usually swirls over the North Pole (a.k.a. the ). Some studies suggest that these changes are bringing more frigid temperatures to lower latitudes and causing , allowing storms to produce more snowfall. This may explain what we’ve experienced  over the past few decades, as well as a wintertime , although exactly how the Arctic affects global weather remains a topic of .Climate change may also explain the apparent paradox behind some of the other places on Earth that haven’t warmed much. For instance, a splotch of water in the North Atlantic has cooled in recent years, and scientists say they suspect that may be because  as a result of freshwater streaming off . If this circulation grinds almost to a halt, as it’s done in the geologic past, it would alter weather patterns around the world.Not all cold weather stems from some counterintuitive consequence of climate change. But it’s a good reminder that Earth’s climate system is complex and chaotic, so the effects of human-caused changes will play out differently in different places. That’s why “global warming” is a bit of an oversimplification. Instead, some scientists have suggested that the phenomenon of human-caused climate change would more aptly be called “.”.Wildfires and bad weather have always happened. How do we know there’s a connection to climate change?Extreme weather and natural disasters are part of life on Earth — just ask the dinosaurs. But there is good evidence that climate change has increased the frequency and severity of certain phenomena like heat waves, droughts and floods. Recent research has also allowed scientists to identify the influence of climate change on specific events.Let’s start with . Studies show that stretches of abnormally high temperatures now happen about five than they would without climate change, and they last longer, too. Climate models project that, by the 2040s, heat waves will be about 12 times more frequent. And that’s concerning since extreme heat often causes increased hospitalizations and deaths, particularly among older people and those with underlying health conditions. In the summer of 2003, for example, a heat wave caused an estimated  across Europe. (Human-caused warming .)Climate change has also , primarily by increasing evaporation. Droughts occur naturally because of random climate variability and factors like whether El Niño or La Niña conditions prevail in the tropical Pacific. But some researchers have found evidence that greenhouse warming has been affecting droughts since even . And it continues to do so today. , the drought that afflicted the American Southwest from 2000 to 2018 was almost 50 percent more severe because of climate change. It was the worst drought the region had experienced in more than 1,000 years.Rising temperatures have also increased the intensity of heavy precipitation events and the flooding that often follows. For example, studies have found that, because warmer air holds more moisture, Hurricane Harvey, which struck Houston in 2017, dropped between 15 and 40 percent  than it would have without climate change.It’s still unclear whether climate change is changing the overall frequency of hurricanes, but it is . And warming appears to favor certain kinds of weather patterns, like the “” events that caused devastating flooding across the .It’s important to remember that in most natural disasters, there are multiple factors at play. For instance, the 2019 Midwest floods occurred after a recent cold snap had frozen the ground solid, preventing the soil from absorbing rainwater and increasing runoff into the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. These waterways have also been reshaped by  and other forms of river engineering, some of which failed in the floods.Wildfires are another phenomenon with multiple causes. In many places, fire risk has increased because humans have aggressively fought natural fires and prevented Indigenous peoples from carrying out traditional burning practices. This has allowed fuel to accumulate that .However, climate change still plays a major role by heating and drying forests, turning them into tinderboxes. Studies show that warming is the driving factor behind the recent increases in wildfires;  found that climate change is responsible for doubling the area burned across the American West between 1984 and 2015. And researchers say that warming will only make fires bigger and more dangerous in the future..How bad are the effects of climate change going to be?It depends on how aggressively we act to address climate change. If we continue with business as usual, by the end of the century, it will be  during heat waves in the Middle East and .  Central America, the Mediterranean and southern Africa. And many island nations and low-lying areas, from Texas to Bangladesh, will be overtaken by rising seas. Conversely, climate change could bring welcome warming and extended growing seasons to the , Canada, the Nordic countries and Russia. Farther north, however, the loss of snow, ice and permafrost will upend the traditions of Indigenous peoples and threaten infrastructure.It’s complicated, but the underlying message is simple: unchecked climate change will likely . At a national level, poorer countries will be hit hardest, even though they have historically emitted  that cause warming. That’s because many less developed countries tend to be in tropical regions where additional warming will make the climate increasingly intolerable for humans and crops. These nations also often have greater vulnerabilities, like large coastal populations and people living in improvised housing that is easily damaged in storms. And they have fewer resources to adapt, which will require expensive measures like redesigning cities, engineering coastlines and changing how people grow food.Already, between 1961 and 2000, climate change appears to have harmed the economies of the poorest countries while boosting the fortunes of the wealthiest nations that have done the most to cause the problem, making the  25 percent bigger than it would otherwise have been. Similarly, the  found that lower income countries — like Myanmar, Haiti and Nepal — rank high on the list of nations most affected by extreme weather between 1999 and 2018. Climate change has also contributed to increased human migration, which is expected to .Even within wealthy countries, the poor and marginalized will suffer the most. People with more resources have greater buffers, like air-conditioners to keep their houses cool during dangerous heat waves, and the means to pay the resulting energy bills. They also have an easier time evacuating their homes before disasters, and recovering afterward. Lower income people have fewer of these advantages, and they are also more likely to live in  and work outdoors, where they face the brunt of climate change.These inequalities will play out on an individual, community, and regional level. A 2017  found that, under business as usual, the poorest one-third of counties, which are concentrated in the South, will experience damages totaling as much as 20 percent of gross domestic product, while others, mostly in the northern part of the country, will see modest economic gains. Solomon Hsiang, an economist at University of California, Berkeley, and the lead author of the study, has said that climate change “may result in the largest transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich in the country’s history.”Even the climate “winners” will not be immune from all climate impacts, though. Desirable locations will face an influx of migrants. And as the coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated, disasters in one place quickly ripple across our globalized economy. For instance, scientists expect climate change to increase the odds of multiple crop failures occurring at the same time in different places, throwing the world .On top of that, warmer weather is aiding the spread of infectious diseases and the vectors that transmit them, like . Research has also identified troubling correlations between rising temperatures and increased , and climate change is widely recognized as a “threat multiplier” that increases the  within and between countries. In other words, climate change will bring many changes that no amount of money can stop. What could help is taking action to limit warming..What will it cost to do something about climate change, versus doing nothing?One of the most common arguments against taking aggressive action to combat climate change is that doing so will  and cripple the economy. But this implies that there’s an alternative in which we pay nothing for climate change. And unfortunately, there isn’t. In reality, not tackling , and cause enormous human suffering and ecological damage, while transitioning to a greener economy would benefit many people and ecosystems around the world.Let’s start with how much it will cost to address climate change. To keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius, the goal of the Paris Climate Agreement, society will have to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of this century. That will require  in things like renewable energy, electric cars and charging infrastructure, not to mention efforts to adapt to hotter temperatures, rising sea-levels and other unavoidable effects of current climate changes. And we’ll have to make changes fast.Estimates of the cost vary widely. One  found that keeping warming to 2 degrees Celsius would require a total investment of between $4 trillion and $60 trillion, with a median estimate of $16 trillion, while keeping warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius could cost between $10 trillion and $100 trillion, with a median estimate of $30 trillion. (For reference, the entire world economy was about $88 trillion in 2019.) Other studies have found that reaching net zero will require annual investments ranging from less than  of global gross domestic product to as much as . That’s a lot, but within the range of  in countries like the U.S.Now, let’s consider the costs of unchecked climate change, which will fall hardest on the most vulnerable. These include damage to property and infrastructure from sea-level rise and extreme weather, death and sickness linked to natural disasters, pollution and infectious disease, reduced agricultural yields and lost labor productivity because of rising temperatures, decreased water availability and increased energy costs, and species extinction and habitat destruction. Dr. Hsiang, the U.C. Berkeley economist, describes it as “death by a thousand cuts.”As a result, climate damages are hard to quantify.  estimates that even 2 degrees Celsius of warming will cost the world $69 trillion by 2100, and economists expect the toll to keep rising with the temperature. In , economists estimated the cost would equal 5 percent of global G.D.P. at 3 degrees Celsius of warming (our trajectory under current policies) and 10 percent for 5 degrees Celsius. Other research indicates that, if current warming trends continue, global G.D.P. per capita will decrease between and  by the end of the century — an economic blow equivalent to  every year. And some fear these are .Already, studies suggest that climate change has  in the poorest countries by as much as 30 percent and reduced by 21 percent since 1961. Extreme weather events have also racked up a large bill. In 2020, in the United States alone, climate-related disasters like hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires caused  in damages to businesses, property and infrastructure, compared to an average of $18 billion per year in the 1980s.Given the steep price of inaction, many economists say that addressing climate change is . It’s like that old saying: an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. In this case, limiting warming will greatly reduce future damage and inequality caused by climate change. It will also produce so-called co-benefits, like  by reducing air pollution, and millions more from eating healthier, climate-friendly diets. Some studies even find that meeting the Paris Agreement goals could  and . And, of course, reining in climate change will spare many species and ecosystems upon which humans depend — and which many people believe to have their own innate value.The challenge is that we need to reduce emissions now to avoid damages later, which requires big investments over the next few decades. And the longer we delay, the more we will pay to meet the Paris goals. One  found that reaching net-zero by 2050 would cost the U.S. almost twice as much if we waited until 2030 instead of acting now. But even if we miss the Paris target, the economics still make a strong case for climate action, because every additional degree of warming will  — in dollars, and in lives..Veronica Penney contributed reporting.Illustration photographs by Esther Horvath, Max Whittaker, David Maurice Smith and Talia Herman for The New York Times; Esther Horvath/Alfred-Wegener-InstitutVeronica Penney contributed reporting."
"11","Article 11","Here on planet Earth, things could be going better. The rise in atmospheric temperatures from greenhouse gases poses the most dire threat to humanity, measured on a scale of potential suffering, since Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany launched near-simultaneous wars of conquest. And the problem has turned out to be much harder to solve. It's not the money. The cost of transitioning away from fossil fuels, measured as a share of the economy, may amount to a fraction of the cost of defeating the Axis powers. Rather, it is the politics that have proved so fiendish. Fighting a war is relatively straightforward: You spend all the money you can to build a giant military and send it off to do battle. Climate change is a problem that politics is almost designed not to solve. Its costs lie mostly in the distant future, whereas politics is built to respond to immediate conditions. (And of the wonders the internet has brought us, a lengthening of mental time horizons is not among them.) Its solution requires coordination not of a handful of allies but of scores of countries with wildly disparate economies and political structures. There has not yet been a galvanizing Pearl Harbor moment, when the urgency of action becomes instantly clear and isolationists melt away. Instead, it breeds counterproductive mental reactions: denial, fatalism, and depression.This fall, as world leaders prepare to gather in Paris for the United Nations climate-change conference in December and bureaucrats bureaucratize, onlookers could be excused for treating the whole affair with weariness. As early as the 19th century, scientists had observed that the release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere trapped heat that would otherwise have escaped into outer space. It took until 1997 for the U.N. to draw up a rough deal, in Kyoto, Japan, designed to arrest what was by then obviously a crisis. The agreement failed on the international stage, which didn't stop the Republicans in the U.S. Senate, who hoped to use the treaty as fodder for attack ads, from bringing the moribund issue up for a vote - where it failed again, 95-0.It was another decade until the next major attempt to coordinate international action, in Copenhagen, Denmark. That failed too. Then, in 2010, President Obama, temporarily enjoying swollen Democratic majorities in both houses, tried to pass a cap-and-trade law that would bring the U.S. into compliance with the reductions it had pledged in Copenhagen. A handful of Democrats from fossil-fuel states joined with nearly every Republican to filibuster it.In the intervening years, the crisis has become rapidly less theoretical, as mountain snows have permanently disappeared, jungles have been burned for cropland, ice sheets have crumbled. Rather than galvanizing action, this merely depressed us. This July, as the planet endured its hottest month in recorded history, the former NASA climate scientist James Hansen revised his predictions and issued preliminary conclusions that, while controversial among other scientists, were terrifying: Sea levels might be rising three times faster than estimated, and within a few decades, ""forced migrations and economic collapse might make the planet ungovernable, threatening the fabric of civilization."" The philosopher Dale Jamieson has a recent book titled Reason in a Dark Time: Why the Struggle Against Climate Change Failed - And What It Means for Our Future. Jonathan Franzen recently wrote an ostentatiously morbid essay in The New Yorker positing that ""drastic planetary overheating is a done deal."" The drama has taken on an air of inevitability, of a tragedy at the outset of its final scene - the tension so unbearable, and the weight of looming catastrophe so soul-crushing, that some people seek the release of final defeat rather than endless struggle in the face of hopeless odds. Working for change, or even hoping for it, has felt like a sucker's game. It is hard even to conceive of good global-warming news when bad news is the only kind that has ever existed.But guess what everyone's been missing in the middle of their keening for the dear, soon-to-be-departed Earth? There is good news. And not just incremental good news but transformational good news, developments that have the potential to mitigate the worst effects of climate change to a degree many had feared impossible. Those who have consigned the world to its doom should reconsider. The technological and political underpinnings are at last in place to actually consummate the first global pact to limit greenhouse-gas emissions. The world is suddenly responding to the climate emergency with - by the standards of its previous behavior - astonishing speed. The game is not over. And the good guys are starting to win.For human to wean ourselves off carbon-emitting fossil fuel, we will have to use some combination of edict and invention - there is no other plausible way around it. The task before the world is best envisioned not as a singular event but as two distinct but interrelated revolutions, one in political willpower and the other in technological innovation. It has taken a long time for each to materialize, in part because the absence of one has compounded the difficulty of the other. It is extremely hard to force a shift to clean energy when dirty energy is much cheaper, and it is extremely hard to achieve economies of scale in new energy technologies when the political system has not yet nudged you to do so.And yet, if you formed a viewpoint about the cost effectiveness of green energy a generation ago (when, for instance, Ronald Reagan tore the costly solar panels installed by his predecessor off the White House roof), or even just a few years ago, your beliefs are out of date. That technological revolution is well under way.For one thing, the price of solar is falling, and rapidly. In a March 2011 post for Scientific American's website, Ramez Naam, a computer scientist and technological enthusiast, compared the rapid progress of solar power to Moore's Law, the famous dictum that described the process by which microchips grew steadily more useful over time, doubling in efficiency every two years. The price of solar power had fallen in two decades from nearly $10 a watt to about $3. By 2030, he predicted, the price could drop to just 50 cents a watt.Four years later, in the spring of this year, Naam revisited his post and admitted his prediction had been wrong. It was far too conservative. The price of solar power had already hit the 50-cent threshold. In the sunniest locations in the world, building a new solar-power plant now costs less than coal or natural gas, even without subsidies, and within six years, this will be true of places with average sunlight, too. Taller turbines, with longer and more powerful blades, have made wind power competitive in a growing swath of the country (the windy parts). By 2023, new wind power is expected to cost less than new power plants burning natural gas.Meanwhile, the coal industry has gone into free fall. In 2009, 523 coal plants operated in the United States. More than 200 of them have since shut down, displaced mostly by natural-gas plants, which emit half as much carbon dioxide. (The most common process of drilling for gas, fracking, does release methane, a super-powerful greenhouse gas, but the Obama administration's just-released regulation will address those leaks for the first time.) Only one coal-fired plant has been green-lit since 2008, and new regulations make it virtually certain that no coal plant will break ground in the United States ever again.The energy revolution has rippled widely through the economy. In the first half of this year, renewable-energy installations accounted for 70 percent of new electrical power. As the energy mix has grown cleaner, people have found ways to use less of it, too. Incandescent bulbs have been replaced with efficient LEDs, in what Prajit Ghosh, director of power and renewables research at energy company Wood Mackenzie, refers to as a ""total bulb revolution."" Tesla has introduced a new home battery, the ""Powerwall,"" and broken ground on a plant in Nevada, called the Gigafactory, with the capacity to churn out 500,000 lithium-ion battery packs per year, which will allow it to cut battery costs by a third and sell less expensive electric cars. And these are only today's technologies. Laboratories from Cambridge to Silicon Valley are racing to develop next-generation batteries, as well as ultra­efficient solar cells, vehicles, kitchen appliances. For more than a century, everything that consumed energy was designed without a thought to the carbon dioxide that would be released into the air. Now everything from buildings to refrigerators is being designed anew to account for scientific reality.This is a story of ingenuity, but it is not, as Jeb Bush has suggested, thanks simply to ""a person in a garage somewhere that's going to come up with a disruptive technology that's going to solve these problems."" The energy market has been disrupted because governments disrupted it; progress came not in spite of our government but because of it. The private sector developed LED bulbs because Washington required higher-efficiency lighting. The post-crash stimulus package pumped $90 billion into green-energy subsidies, as China and Germany made similar public investments. The Obama administration churned out regulations forcing higher energy standards on the automobile industry, buildings, agriculture, and oil and drilling. Its Clean Power Plan, which will require for the first time that states reduce emissions from their power plants, is the capstone of the first major response to climate change in American history.This full-court press was Obama's goal in 2009, when he tried to persuade Congress to pass a law creating a cap-and-trade market for carbon. After the bill failed the following year, environmentalists sank into despair - where many of them have stayed slumped ever since, having decided the battle is lost. When the first signs emerged, shortly after the 2012 election, that the Obama administration might use its regulatory authority to limit power-plant emissions, dejected liberals waved away the prospect as a fairy tale. Now it is a fait accompli, and the main argument environmentalists make to dismiss Obama's climate plan is not that he will never have the guts to do it but that it merely ratifies a clean-energy revolution driven by market forces. The overall direction of American carbon use is no longer in doubt. American carbon emissions peaked in 2007 and have fallen since, with the main question now being how far and fast they will plummet.Conservatives tend to dismiss efforts to limit American greenhouse-gas emissions by pointing out that global warming, if it exists at all, is an international problem rather than an American one. Reducing emissions in the U.S. alone can barely budge global temperatures. This is factually correct. The U.S. once led the world in greenhouse-gas emissions but has long since been overtaken by China, which now emits twice as much total carbon. The mistake the conservatives have made lies in their assumption that American policy has no bearing upon Chinese policy. The two have turned out to be closely linked. China, in fact, has undergone an energy revolution far more rapid than anything under way in the U.S. - the country that supposedly couldn't be shamed into action has, instead, shamed us. As a result, the scale and pace of the change are almost incomprehensible.The reversal happened quickly. As China has industrialized, it's followed the same path of cheap, dirty energy that the U.S. and Europe had blazed a century before. Over the past quarter-century, Chinese emissions quadrupled. Lifting the oppressive burden of poverty from China's people required huge quantities of carbon, and the process had no end in sight. As recently as 2009, analysts believed China's carbon-emissions level would continue to rise, not reaching its peak until 2050.The development of a vast new source of global warming in the East, just as the West was making a dent in its emissions, provided the single largest reason for the feeling of helplessness that has pervaded environmentalism. Worse, most of the developing world longed to replicate China's astonishing new prosperity. The Chinese model suggested that horrific poverty could be escaped only at a horrific global cost. It is hardly selfish for developing countries to refuse to force their impoverished people to shoulder the burden of averting climate change. (Even now, China burns less than half as much carbon per person than does the U.S.) The developing world has thus been presented with a brutal moral logic: The rich countries have burned through the world's carbon budget, and there is almost nothing left.But in the past year, something amazing has taken place. In 2014, China's coal production and its consumption both fell, and the drop appears to be continuing, or even accelerating, this year. Derek Scissors, a China analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, who had previously believed Chinese coal use would rebound, conceded his error and called the shocking reversal ""an economic and social sea change."" China's coal use has made the air in its largest cities intolerable, and Communist Party elites have to breathe the same air as everybody else. The regime's long-standing desire to fix its air pollution has been well known, but that desire has only now translated into results.China has made colossal investments in green energy. It plans to increase its solar-energy capacity this year alone by 18 gigawatts - as much solar-energy capacity as exists in the U.S. right now. Its wind-energy production has increased tenfold in a half-dozen years, and the country is in the midst of what one analyst called ""the largest build-out of hydroelectricity the world has ever seen."" Last fall, in a bilateral agreement with the U.S., China promised its carbon-dioxide emissions would peak in 2030 - two decades earlier than recently believed. And at the current rate of transformation, this promise appears conservative. China is widely expected to move its peak-emissions date up to 2025 by the Paris conference.When the Chinese government announced its participation in the bilateral agreement, American conservatives rolled their eyes. Their skepticism that China would curtail its emissions rested upon the premise that maintaining its prosperity required it to burn ever-increasing amounts of dirty energy, forever. ""China almost certainly won't take significant steps to reduce carbon emission,"" explained National Review. ""That's because the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist party's government rests squarely on economic development. Energy - often produced by dirty coal - allows that economic development to occur, lifting millions out of hand-to-mouth poverty."" This analysis relied upon a fatally flawed assumption: that producing more energy required producing more carbon emissions. China is finding ways to produce more energy with less carbon. The ratio of carbon emissions to energy produced is called ""carbon intensity,"" and China's carbon-intensity ratio has dropped precipitously. In 2009, China promised to reduce its carbon intensity by 45 percent from its 2005 level by 2020. It is well on track to achieve this (it's already down 34 percent), and is now promising to deepen the cut to 60 or 65 percent - evidence that China has begun thinking seriously and practically about what it will mean to steward the majority of the world's future population.The energy revolution in China has laid the groundwork for a future scarcely anybody could have imagined just a few years ago. For most of the 1.3 billion people globally without access to electricity, building new solar power is already cheaper than fossil-fuel generation. And so, the possibility has come into view that, just as the developing world is skipping landlines and moving straight into cellular communication, it will forgo the dirty-energy path and follow a clean one. The global poor can create a future of economic growth for themselves without burning the world.That is the achievable - truly achievable! - task now before the world as its leaders gather in Paris. For the first time, countries are negotiating an agreement while both revolutions, political and technological, are under way and mutually reinforcing. The plummeting financial cost of renewable energy has decreased the political cost for leaders of the developing world. And the agreement between the U.S. and China - the respective leaders of the developed and the developing worlds - has set a template whose particulars can be strengthened over time.In advance of the conference, the outlines of a rough global consensus have come into view. Brazil has pledged to ramp up its renewable-energy production and to prevent further destruction of its rain forests, which help trap carbon. South Korea has promised a 37 percent cut in its emissions by 2030. India, a poorer country than China that emits one-tenth as much carbon per person as the U.S., has not yet committed to a firm date when its carbon emissions will peak. But it quintupled its target for installing new solar power, and its political leaders have embraced progressive climate views.The West has responded in kind. The European Union has pledged to cut 40 percent (from its 1990 level). Pope Francis's public embrace of climate change as a life-or-death issue has affirmed its place as a shared global vision. No government in the world has challenged either the existence of anthropogenic global warming or the urgent need to bring the world together to halt it. And Obama's increasingly visible crusading for action, including his recent trip to Alaska, is the action of a president who realizes his legacy could not be rescued from a failure in Paris and who has the conviction that failure cannot and will not happen. Almost one century ago, a conference in Paris (Versailles, actually) doomed the world to its darkest moment. The stage is now set for a conference in Paris that will alter the course of human history for the better.If this sounds surprisingly optimistic, that may be because you reside in a highly peculiar place: the United States of America. If there is a single vantage point from which the new global consensus on climate change is least evident, other than perhaps Saudi Arabia, it is the U.S. In a survey last year of 20 countries, the U.S. had the highest proportion of citizens who disagree that climate change is the result of human activity. And that is not because the U.S. is especially abundant in fossil fuels, or unusually removed from the effects of a changing climate, but because one of our two major parties is completely sui generis. From 2001 to 2010, a period when the scientific community grew more certain that heat-trapping gases were warming the atmosphere, the proportion of Republicans who believe the effects of climate change had already set in actually declined from 50 percent to 30 percent.The unique quality of the Republican Party's climate doctrine can be found not in its Donald Trumps and its Ted Cruzes but in their putatively sane competitors in the 2016 presidential primary. ""I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it,"" said Marco Rubio last year. A spokesman for Scott Walker asserted recently that the governor ""believes facts have shown that there has not been any measurable warming in the last 15 or 20 years."" Even John Kasich, who has carved a niche on the far-left wing of his party's presidential field for refusing to boycott the Medicaid expansion in Obamacare, has dismissed the scientific consensus as ""some theory that's not proven."" Jeb Bush has tried to dodge. ""I'm a skeptic. I'm not a scientist. I think the science has been politicized,"" he scoffed in 2009. His view has since hardened. ""For the people to say the science is decided on this is really arrogant,"" he asserted earlier this year.And the tenor of Republican thinking below the level of presidential candidates is cruder still. Dana Rohrabacher, a member of the House Committee on Science and Technology, has claimed ""global warming is a total fraud."" Lamar Smith, the chairman of that committee, has mocked the ""malfunctioning climate models"" designed by ""climate alarmists."" James Inhofe, chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, is the author of a 2012 book titled The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future. Conservative states have refused to entertain plans for the inevitable disappearance of their coastlines; some have even banned the use of the term ""climate change."" Prestigious intellectuals in the conservative movement, like George Will, preach conspiratorial pseudoscientific theories.The U.S. is the only democracy in which such a consensus can be found. (Even the conservative ruling party in coal-rich Australia is submitting proposals to reduce its carbon emissions.) Eileen Claussen, former president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, told National Journal that, while some individuals in other countries question climate science, there is ""no party-wide view like this anywhere in the world that I am aware of."" The Republican Party's complete refusal to accept any limits on greenhouse-gas emissions whatsoever is an unspoken force shaping the Paris negotiations. The outcome cannot be written as a formal treaty, since treaties require approval by the Senate, and Senate approval requires Republicans. Instead, the agreement will take the form of legally nonbinding pledges, which the U.N. is calling ""intended nationally determined contributions,"" enforced by international diplomatic pressure. The entire world is, in essence, tiptoeing gingerly around the unhinged second-largest political party in the world's second-largest greenhouse-gas emitter, in hopes of saving the world behind its back.Of course, it is unfortunate for the future of mankind that climate-change denialism has surfaced as a regional quirk in the most powerful country on Earth. The fossil-fuel industry has invested heavily in U.S. politics and can surely take some credit for the Republican Party's positions, but conservative resentment of climate science is more deeply rooted and pathological than economic influence can fully explain. Conservative distrust of the scientific community has steadily increased over the last four decades. Even as the coal industry has collapsed, and American solar firms now employ twice as many people, the Republican affiliation with coal as a cherished way of life has deepened. Conservatives' association of science with the liberal agenda has hardened Republican resolve to do nothing to limit climate change, which has, in turn, deepened the association of science with the liberal agenda. Increasing evidence of climate change does not halt this vicious cycle. It may actually accelerate it by fomenting resentment. An alarming social study from June found that climate skeptics who read reports about natural disasters were less likely to favor helping the victims if the story connected the disaster to climate change.The Republican view that climate change is uncertain, overblown, or nonexistent has run alongside a long-standing skepticism about international diplomacy. Conservatives treat the prospect of a global agreement to limit emissions as not merely a challenge (which it is) but a conceptual impossibility. The presumed impossibility of getting other countries in general, and China in particular, to cut back on greenhouse gases featured heavily in Republican denunciations of cap and trade during Obama's first two years. They have greeted China's agreement to do this very thing with scorn. When Obama negotiated his bilateral pledge with China last year, conservatives howled, predicting disaster. But they were unable to thwart the deal, and now they dismiss China's emissions pledges as too easy to fulfill. (Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell scoffed that last November's deal ""requires the Chinese to do nothing at all for 16 years."") Or else, too difficult. (""China's commitment to reduce carbon emissions is unattainable and unrealistic,"" wrote Inhofe.) Or they have simply carried on as if China had made no changes to its behavior at all. (Marco Rubio, this summer: ""As far as I can see, China and India and other developing countries are going to continue to burn anything they can get their hands on."")Republicans have set out to induce the result they predict, warning foreign leaders that Obama will not be able to carry out his promises. After Obama formally submitted the U.S.'s proposed emission reductions to the United Nations, McConnell drafted a letter urging the world not to believe him. ""Considering that two-thirds of the U.S. federal government hasn't even signed off on the Clean Power Plan and 13 states have already pledged to fight it,"" he wrote, ""our international partners should proceed with caution before entering into a binding, unattainable deal."" This was an American official warning other countries to ""proceed with caution"" before negotiating with the U.S.The Republican plan to destroy the global climate accord involves domestic sabotage as well. The congressional wing will attach to budget bills to fund the government new rules forbidding the EPA from carrying out its regulations. (Obama will veto any such bills, making them a futile symbolic gesture.) Conservatives have also filed suit to block the EPA's regulations, a somewhat more dangerous possibility, but - given that the Supreme Court has already ordered the White House to regulate carbon - not likely to inflict fatal damage.By far the most effective weapon at the GOP's disposal is its prospect of winning the 2016 election. Jeffrey Holmstead, formerly the chief air regulator at the EPA under the Bush administration and now an energy lobbyist, boasts, ""Any Republican candidate that I can imagine would very quickly just rescind the Clean Power Plan."" Jeb Bush has called it ""irresponsible"" and ""overreaching""; Rubio called it ""catastrophic."" They are the relative moderates on the issue - Scott Walker has not only rejected the plan but also promised to eliminate all federal regulation of the environment, except for a small handful of intrastate disputes.And so the world is racing to decarbonize before the Republican Party - as constituted in its current, delirious form - can regain power over the U.S. With the GOP as unpopular as ever, the rest of the planet has a tenuous upper hand. At some point, perhaps only a few years from now, decarbonization will have gained irreversible momentum, strengthening the economic power of the green-energy lobby and weakening the power of the fossil-fuel lobby. And maybe, eventually, the Republican Party will give up its affinity for unlimited carbon emissions, just as it is surrendering on gay marriage. In the meantime, the 2016 election threatens to ruin the new global consensus on climate change. The concentration of American climate policy in the Executive branch, the GOP's descent into madness, and the sudden attainability of international cooperation have all raised the planetary stakes of the presidential election beyond anything in previous experience.If the Paris talks succeed, will the world have acted fully and promptly to limit climate change before it's too late? The atmosphere has already warmed by one degree Celsius since the end of the 19th century. Climate change has already begun. Even if the world could eliminate all fossil-fuel use tomorrow, the amount of carbon already in the atmosphere will create, and is already creating, disruption, havoc, and death. Even if the world halted all greenhouse-gas emissions today, it would be, by the standard of perfection, too late.Besides, the target the world has set for measuring success - holding increased global temperature to no more than two degrees Celsius - is merely a guess at salvation. Exactly how much carbon dioxide can we pump into the air and stay under two degrees? Scientists estimate that figure is 450 parts per million, but that is only an estimate; 450 parts per million could produce less warming or more.And is under two degrees the safety zone? That is also a guess, and it's an even less precise one. Projecting how human life would change in a world of two-degree warming imagines a vast and complex calculation of natural events that can be predicted hazily: heat waves, drought, animal-species extinctions, and extreme weather. Then you have possible human responses that can only be guessed at wildly, like an increase in refugees, political instability, resource wars. Climate change is not a risk like the danger of wandering up to the edge of a cliff in the darkness, where you either remain safe or plunge to your demise. A rise of 1.9 degrees does not mean salvation, and 2.1 degrees does not mean doom. It is a problem of gradations of suffering and expense - but remaining on the lowest possible point on that terrifying, unknowable scale is a question literally of life or death.Yet misleading metaphors have dominated our thinking about the problem. Is it too late? Have we reached a point of no return? All-or-nothing thinking can be a useful tool for communicating urgency to the public, just as one would communicate the urgency of a war or a clarifying indication of political commitment. But it has also become a trap into which many of us - especially environmentalists - have fallen. In truth, the fight to save the Earth from climate change is not something that will be ""won"" or ""lost."" Climate change is a problem of risk management, albeit on a planetary scope.The most pressing danger is not the likely scenario of what unabated emissions would do - which is bad enough - but the less likely, yet far from impossible, versions, if it turns out that a given level of atmospheric carbon produces more warming than scientists estimate. Unabated, greenhouse-gas emissions could easily produce a much higher spike than forecast. Warmer temperatures might create new effects of their own, like the melting of the permafrost in the Siberian tundra, releasing vast stores of carbon and creating still more heat. The predictions of what happens if humanity cooks the planet entail high levels of uncertainty. Scientists guess that failing to control emissions poses about a 10 percent chance of creating a rise in global temperatures that would make human life as we know it unrecognizable. Americans would rightly consider a 10 percent chance of nuclear war unacceptably large. Even if all the Paris talks do is simply eliminate the risk of the all-too-thinkable worst-case scenario, it would constitute a monumental achievement in the history of human civilization, like the development of modern medicine.The danger of black-and-white moralism is that it can be paralyzing. Ironically, the despair of the left has one quality in common with the denial of the right: They are both coping mechanisms. Denial is conservatism's way of avoiding the collision between its belief that governmental power over the economy must not be extended and the likely truth that climate change is a problem that can only be solved through more government. Despair is a means of coping with the contradiction between the awesome scale of the climate crisis and the paucity of political tools to solve it. Both render us passive bystanders to history and, by hiding our agency, distort our vision of the world. An inability to parse degrees of too little and too late can blind you to something revolutionary and historic taking place.Perhaps this is the best way to judge the world's efforts in Paris: How does the outcome stack up against where the world stood a few years ago? After the 2010 collapse of Obama's attempt to pass a cap-and-trade bill, the world appeared well and truly doomed. China was burning everything, the rest of the developed world was ready to follow along, and the U.S. had no obvious path to get its emissions under control.Since that point, the long-awaited green revolution has finally arrived. Both energy technology and cooperative international willpower, mired for years in stasis, have been set into furious motion. The negotiators have constructed a different dynamic this time. Rather than set overall limits and require reductions of every country, they will get individual countries to set their own targets. The opening bids by the U.S., China, and Brazil have been an encouraging start.The limits agreed to at Paris will not be enough to spare the world mass devastation. But they are the beginning of a framework upon which progressively stronger requirements can be built over time. The willpower and innovation that have begun to work in tandem can continue to churn. Eventually the world will wean itself almost completely off carbon-based energy. There is, suddenly, hope."
"12","Article 12","By Brad Plumer and John Schwartz | Graphics by Nadja Popovich | Illustrations by Mathilde AubierEarth Day turns 50 today. The original wave of coast-to-coast demonstrations in 1970 not only transformed American priorities, leading to landmark legislation like the Clean Air Act, but helped shape the modern global environmental movement.In the past half-century, air and water pollution have plummeted in the United States, the bald eagle is no longer endangered, and environmental laws pioneered in America have set a model for nations around the world. But since then, other threats have grown, including climate change, tropical deforestation and a staggering loss of global biodiversity.Here is a look at what's gotten better and what's gotten worse in the five decades since millions of people marched to demand a cleaner, healthier environment.In 1969, oil-soaked debris on the Cuyahoga River near Cleveland briefly caught fire. The blaze was small, and extinguished quickly, but consequential: It became a galvanizing symbol for a clean-water movement at the heart of the first Earth Day.The nation's waterways were astonishingly dirty at that time. Cities large and small were flushing raw sewage into rivers without treating it. One study found that 90 percent of drinking water systems in eight metro areas had excess levels of microbes of the sort that were making people ill by the thousands.''There was a sense that rivers and lakes had just become sewers,'' said Adam Rome, a historian at the University of Buffalo.Time magazine in 1969 captured the filthy state of the nation's water in an exposéthat highlighted the fire on the Cuyahoga, elevating the blaze to legendary status (even though river fires were a fading problem by then, thanks to local efforts).Congress soon accelerated the cleanup. The Clean Water Act of 1972 restricted the dumping of waste and led to more than $650 billion in spending on treatment plants. Today, places like Boston Harbor, once a stew of toxic chemicals, are home once again to striped bass, seals and even whales.Plenty of problems linger. The Environmental Protection Agencystill classifies a significant fraction of rivers and streams as ''impaired,'' though over all, the nation's waterways are significantly cleaner. And today there is a new water concern: The health of the high seas.Back then, all eyes were on rivers. Today, a bigger concern is the world's oceans.A major reason is global warming, which was barely on the nation's radar in 1970. Ocean temperatures have soared in recent decades, because of increases in heat-trapping greenhouse gases from vehicles and power plants. Many of the richest coral reefs, including the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia, now suffer frequent die-offs.There is a wealth of evidence, which didn't exist during the first Earth Day, that climate change is imperiling a vast array of marine life. By the early 2000s, scientists realized that carbon dioxide emissions from industrial activity would make the oceans dangerously more acidic, throwing ecosystems into disarray.Fish populations are now declining in many parts of the world as waters warm. Combined with unsustainable fishing practices, that could threaten food supplies and livelihoods.After Earth Day, environmentalists and policymakers concluded that local efforts were insufficient to clean America's rivers and lakes. Similarly today, experts say that no single country alone can solve the oceans' problems. Instead, nations need to work together to limit plastic pollution, rein in overfishing and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reduce the pressure on marine life.You know those photos we see today of polluted air above the cities of India and Eastern Europe?It used to be like that in the United States: Pollution thick enough to blot out the sun.In the 1940s, Pittsburgh was so dark it kept the street lamps on during the day. And in New York City in the decade before 1970, deaths from emphysema rose 500 percent. Air pollution was increasingly considered a key factor. ''On the autopsy table, it's unmistakable,'' a city medical examiner said at the time. ''The person who spent his life in the Adirondacks has nice pink lungs. The city dweller's are black as coal.''A few months after the first Earth Day, Congress passed the Clean Air Act, one of the most far-reaching environmental laws in American history. It was part of a wave of government action that would include the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency.Since then, air quality in the United States has improved tremendously, which has been a boon for public health. Power plants and factories have had to adopt scrubbers and other techniques to clean up emissions. And while automakers initially resisted, they eventually agreed to install technologies like catalytic converters to remove exhaust pollutants.Today, cars are cleaner. Acid rain has become a trivia question. The E.P.A. estimates that hundreds of thousands of lives were saved in 2020 alone because of the Clean Air Act. And although industry groups initially said regulations would impose crippling burdens, the costs of compliance haven't kept the economy from growing.Even so, the E.P.A. says that more than 110 million Americans still live in counties with unhealthy pollution today. And since 2016, particulate pollution has begun to tick back up.Now, about the air in China, India and other developing countries.Things have gotten bad.Part of the backdrop for the first Earth Day was that, by 1970, many Americans had become financially secure enough, thanks to decades of economic growth, to focus on curbing the pollution caused by industrial progress.But it has taken longer for other countries to reach that tipping point.In China, which has built several hundred coal plants since the 1990s, air pollution is reducing life expectancy by about three years on average, one study estimated. In New Delhi, the air became so foul in 2019 that officials declared an emergency, closing schools and distributing millions of face masks. In Poland, aging cars and coal plants have smothered cities in smog.There are signs of change: China has begun restricting vehicles and coal plants around cities like Beijing. India is investing heavily in solar power.Still, there's a long way to go. The World Health Organization estimates that air pollution causes about 7 million premature deaths annually worldwide -- more than those from AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined.From the start, oil has been a dirty business.The immense gusher at Spindletop, Texas, in 1901, the dawn of the modern age of oil, created a mess so sprawling that ''the countryside and crops for miles around were covered with a blanket of oil,'' Stephen Harrigan wrote in ''Big Wonderful Thing: A History of Texas.''The oil barons were not environmentalists, and the nation was hungry for energy.But in 1969, a blowout off the coast of Santa Barbara changed all that, befouling 35 miles of California coastline, sparking national outrage and serving as a catalyst for the first Earth Day. The disaster helped drive dozens of state and federal environmental laws, as well as curbs on offshore drilling.Despite that, we still see horrific damage including the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound, Alaska, in 1989, and the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico 10 years ago this month. Overall, though, ''the annual number and volume of oil spills have shown declines -- in some cases, dramatic declines,'' according to a 2017 Congressional Research Service report.Back then, it was an oil-spill crisis that rallied attention. Today, it's the climate crisis.Between 1970 and 2018, the global use of fossil fuels like coal, oil and natural gas more than doubled.While that energy has helped lift more than a billion people out of poverty, the burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that is warming the planet -- a threat not as widely appreciated during the first Earth Day.Scientists have known since the 19th century that shifts in carbon dioxide levels could cause planetary warming. Since then, the scientific evidence has only firmed up that human activity, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, is warming the planet. ''It is already happening now,'' the NASA scientist James Hansen told Congress in 1988.Earth has now warmed roughly 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) since the dawn of the industrial age, and will heat up further unless nations limit and ultimately reverse the rise in emissions. That means finding alternatives to fossil fuels such as oil.Failure to do so looks ugly. The United Nations scientific panel on climate change said in 2018 that, without aggressive action, many millions more people worldwide could soon be exposed to life-threatening heat waves, water shortages and coastal flooding.In recent years, renewable energy sources, notably wind turbines and solar panels, have become credible alternatives to fossil fuels, thanks to tumbling costs.One result: Some now say climate change might not be as intractable a problem as it once seemed. Al Gore, the former vice president who's been issuing warnings about climate change for years, said in 2015 the sudden viability of renewables had given him new optimism. ''I think most people have been surprised, even shocked, by how quickly the cost has come down,'' he said.It's quite a shift from 50 years ago. Back then, energy options were largely limited to burning fossil fuels or building nuclear power plants or immense hydropower projects. The latter two often sparked controversy: Think Three Mile Island, or the nasty fights over dams that submerged communities.Wind and solar were considered fringe during the first Earth Day. Only after the oil crises of the 1970s did policymakers start seriously promoting renewable energy, and those efforts took decades to gain traction. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter installed 32 solar panels on the White House roof to heat water. Two years later, Ronald Reagan ordered their removal.Today, both wind and solar are mainstream.The cost of solar panels has fallen more than 99 percent since 1975, and in some regions it has become cheaper to build new wind or solar farms than it is to operate existing coal plants. Solar and wind supplied 6 percent of the world's electricity in 2017 and are growing at double-digit annual rates.Wind turbines, solar panels and electric cars may be gaining acceptance, but they aren't growing nearly fast enough to break humanity's addiction to fossil fuels.Solving climate change remains a herculean challenge, and the world still isn't close.To achieve the goal set by the world's governments -- keeping total global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) -- scientists say that greenhouse gas emissions from coal, oil and natural gas will need to peak within a decade and then rapidly decline to zero well before the end of the century. But the International Energy Agency recently said emissions were still on track to rise for another 20 years.While renewable energy has been growing, that's been offset somewhat by the decline of nuclear power. And global energy demand keeps growing rapidly, particularly in emerging economies. That means fossil fuel use has continued rising to fill the gap.To meet the world's climate goals, experts say, most countries would need to set much more aggressive policies. Those might include taxing carbon dioxide emissions, investing more heavily in clean energy and efficiency, and curbing methane leaks from oil and gas operations.There have been positive steps. The European Union and California, for instance, have set goals of net zero emissions by 2050.Nevertheless, China, the world's largest emitter, has resisted setting a date for zero emissions. And in the United States, the world's second largest source of carbon pollution, the Trump administration has disavowed action on climate change.Before the first Earth Day, there was the pioneering environmental journalist Rachel Carson. She wrote about the threat of pesticides like DDT in her 1962 bestseller ''Silent Spring.''Chemical companies attacked her, but her work helped inspire the first Earth Day: Organizers demanded that DDT be banned, alongside calls for the removal of lead from paint and gasoline. Lead use was common at the time, although there is no safe level of exposure, and children are particularly vulnerable.In 1972 the newly created Environmental Protection Agency prohibited DDT. A year later, the E.P.A. announced rules to gradually phase out lead from gasoline. The government later tackled other sources of exposure, banning the sale of lead paint in 1978 and lead plumbing in 1986.Actions like these paid off. Between the late 1970s and 2016, the lead level in the blood of most Americans dropped by nearly 94 percent.Still, in some parts of the United States, lead in drinking water remains a threat from old pipes still in use. In Flint, Mich., some samples have shown100 times the level set by the E.P.A. to trigger government response. Similar spikes have occurred in Washington, D.C., andNewark, N.J.Those early successes gave way to endless arguments over many other chemicals and whether to restrict them or not.Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act in 1976. President Gerald Ford said the law would provide ''broad discretionary authority to protect the health and environment,'' and the E.P.A. over time developed a list of 85,000 chemicals in commercial use.Not all of those are hazardous, of course. But known toxic chemicals like methylene chloride, a paint stripper linked to dozens of deaths, and TCE, a degreaser associated with cancer, have been caught up in battles between regulators and industry over restricting their use.Why the slow progress? Not only did the law provide little power to the E.P.A. for curtailing toxic chemicals, but courts later enfeebled the agency further. Two years after regulators banned most products that contained asbestos in 1989, a federal appeals court overturned much of the rule.Congress toughened the law in 2016 when it passed requirements that the E.P.A. evaluate untested chemicals. Under President Trump, however, the E.P.A. postponed long-sought bans on three chemicals used in consumer products that have been tied to inhalation deaths, cancer and birth defects.The administration also weakened a proposed standard for cleaning up drinking water polluted with the chemicals commonly known as PFAS, and rejected the advice of its own chemical safety experts who in the previous administration had recommended banning the commercial use of the insecticide chlorpyrifos. These are just some of nearly 100 environmental rollbacks under the Trump administration.The California condor. The bald eagle. The Florida manatee.By the time of the first Earth Day, all these species were facing shocking declines.In 1967, for the first time, the Interior Department officially listed 78 bird, fish and mammal species as ''endangered,'' but the agency lacked the authority to protect them.One of the major legacies of the first Earth Day was a strengthened Endangered Species Act. In 1973, Congress dramatically expanded the law, giving the government more power to restrict activities that could harm at-risk species.The act has scored some striking successes: More than 1,700 plants and animals have since been protected under the law and roughly 99 percent have avoided extinction. The bald eagle has rebounded impressively in the lower 48 states, going from just 487 nesting pairs in the 1960s to more than 11,000 by 2007 (although the ban on DDT, which had weakened eagles' egg shells, also gets credit there).Grizzly bears, gray wolves, whooping cranes and California sea otters have all increased in number since gaining protections.But there have also been plenty of challenges.Critics point out that, to date, fewer than 50 species listed under the act have recovered to the point where they no longer need protection. Industry groups and landowners have often argued that the law can impose unreasonable costs on them, while the Trump administration and some Republicans in Congress have pushed to overhaul the act, arguing that it unduly restricts ranching, logging and oil drilling.And dozens of species have gone extinct while awaiting the sometimes protracted decision on whether they warranted protection.Despite successes in saving individual species from near-extinction, like the whooping crane, the world is still losing natural habitat at an astonishing rate.Scientists warn that as many as one million plant and animal species could face extinction in the decades ahead, as a result of ever-expanding farming, ranching, logging, hunting, fishing and mining worldwide.Since 1970, the World Wildlife Fund estimates, the sizes of thousands of different wildlife populations have declined by 60 percent on average. In Indonesia, the replacement of rain forest with palm oil plantations has ravaged the habitat of endangered orangutans and Sumatran tigers. In Mozambique, ivory poachers helped kill nearly 7,000 elephants between 2009 and 2011 alone.And a new threat has emerged: Global warming is shifting or shrinking the local climates that various creatures and plants have evolved to survive in.Last year, a comprehensive scientific assessment from the United Nations warned that unless nations step up their efforts to protect what natural habitats are left, they could witness the disappearance of 40 percent of amphibian species, one-third of marine mammals and one-third of reef-forming corals.The authors of that report noted that the risk to biodiversity has become so severe that piecemeal efforts to protect individual species may no longer be sufficient. They called for ''transformative changes'' that include lowering consumption, slimming down agriculture's environmental footprint and cracking down on illegal logging and fishing.Around the world, efforts to create vast protected areas have accelerated.Nations like Costa Rica and Kenya have realized that wildlife refuges can become tourist attractions and moneymakers. In 1992, under the Convention on Biological Diversity, 168 countries vowed to do more; today they have protected more than 15 percent of the world's land and 7 percent of its oceans by setting up nature reserves and wilderness areas.At the same time, some countries have had success in returning once-degraded landscapes back to nature. In Europe, woodland areas have increased by roughly 35,000 square miles since 1990, an area the size of Portugal. China has engaged in a major reforestation campaign in recent decades.Satellite images show that, since 1982, the world has seen a net increase in forest cover.This year, the nations of the world plan to update the Convention on Biological Diversity. Experts warn that they'll need to greatly expand protected areas in order to avoid an extinction crisis. That might mean setting aside 30 percent or even fully half of the Earth for nature, although anything remotely approaching that scale would pose big challenges. What about the people who depend on those lands for livelihood?Meanwhile, the reforestation trend itself isn't entirely positive. Some of the new forests planted in recent years have far less biodiversity than old-growth forests. What's more, in some areas forests are expanding because global warming has enabled trees to grow in places they previously couldn't.And, of course, tropical rainforests continue to suffer serious declines.Tropical forests are home to at least half of all species on Earth. They are crucial to regulating the planet's climate.And they are being cut down at a dramatic rate.In 2018, about 30 million acres were lost, down only slightly from similar losses in 2016 and 2017. Efforts to slow this have been mixed.In the Brazilian Amazon, deforestation declined 70 percent between 2005 and 2014 as governments toughened their oversight and farmers found ways to increase their yields without needing to clear more land. And since 2016, Indonesia has worked to slow the spread of palm oil and paper plantations.But those gains show signs of eroding. Brazil's leader, Jair Bolsanaro, has pledged to open more of the Amazon to business, and deforestation there is rising again. Indonesia's recent forest protections have been offset by accelerated loss in Ghana, Ivory Coast and elsewhere.Scientists say it will be extremely difficult to tame global warming without limiting tropical forest loss. Trees pull carbon dioxide out of the air and store it in their wood and soil. Cutting and burning those trees releases that carbon, warming the planet. By one estimate, tropical deforestation now creates more emissions each year than the entire European Union.Some countries like Norway and Japan have offered tropical nations billions of dollars to preserve their forests, but progress has been limited. ''We're trying to put out a house fire with a teaspoon,'' Frances Seymour, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute,said in 2018.Four years after the first Earth Day, scientists warned of a new threat to the planet.The threat came from hair spray.Gases released by aerosol cans, they said, were ''depleting the ozone layer'' that envelops the planet and protects against ultraviolet radiation, which can contribute to skin cancer and damage crops.By 1977 the U.S. government had banned the chemicals in spray cans. But, of course, threats to the ozone layer weren't only in aerosol cans; chlorofluorocarbons could be found in air conditioners, refrigerators and elsewhere.So the spray-can ban wasn't enough, and by 1985 researchers had discovered a ''hole'' in the ozone layer. That led to one of the great moments of global environmental unity: The Montreal Protocol, signed by the nations of the world in 1987 to phase out CFCs altogether.The treaty largely worked. In 2018, NASA said the treaty had led to a sharp decline in ozone depletion, according to years of satellite analysis.Still, recovery is slow. ''Think of it like a patient with a disease,'' said Susan Solomon, an atmospheric chemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in a 2016 interview. Healing takes years as the molecules already in the atmosphere slowly break down.And people cheat.Monitoring in 2013 showed that progress was slowing; it seemed that factories in China were likely making more CFCs. But then, last year, the numbers were declining again, suggesting China had cracked down.Nations teamed up to fix the hole in the ozone layer. So why can't they do the same for climate change?In other words, why not get all the countries to agree to phase out the greenhouse gases that are warming the planet, much like they did with the CFCs that were creating a big ozone hole?To some extent, this is what the 2015 Paris climate agreement tried to do. Nearly 200 countries came together to set broad goals for reducing greenhouse gases.But there are key differences: Unlike the earlier ozone treaty, which set mandatory deadlines for each country to phase out CFCs, the Paris climate agreement allows nations to chart their own course with voluntary goals. Some nations are still struggling to meet even those modest, self-imposed pledges, while President Trump is withdrawing the United States from the agreement altogether.As it turns out, phasing out greenhouse gases is a vastly more complicated task. By the time nations were ready to ban CFCs, there were readily available substitutes, allowing companies to make relatively easy swaps. By contrast, shifting away from fossil fuels will require transforming how we produce electricity and transport people and goods around the world. It will mean changing how we farm, eat, dress ourselves, build things, and more.There's not one simple technological fix. The global economy will need a rethink.One of the starkest warnings of the 1970s was that there were simply too many people, and not enough food. Widely read books like ''The Population Bomb'' warned of the collapse of civilization.Things didn't turn out that way.The world's population has more than doubled since 1970, to nearly 7.8 billion people. Yet the share of people living in extreme poverty has plummeted.How did the world avoid mass famine? Technology helped. Researchers developed high-yielding crops, and today's farmers can grow more than twice as much corn, rice and wheat on a given area of land, on average, than in 1970.Population growth has also slowed. In the 1960s, the world's population was rising by about 2 percent annually. But as societies get wealthier and better educated, people tend to have fewer kids. Today, the growth rate is about 1 percent per year and falling.Granted, not all the fears were baseless. As populations have risen, the natural world around us has often suffered, and we are warming the planet at a dangerous pace.But the conversation has changed dramatically. Fifty years ago, there was mainstream alarm about population growth, which led to sterilization campaigns and other gruesome policies. Today, that message is virtually absent from environmentalism.By 2050, the United Nations projects that the world will be home to nearly 10 billion people, up from ''just'' 7.8 billion today.One of the big challenges will be to keep feeding everyone without further damaging the natural world. That's a daunting task.Already, global food production occupies about half of all habitable land, generates about one-quarter of humanity's greenhouse gas emissions and is a major factor behind the decline of biodiversity worldwide. If farmers continue meeting growing demand by clearing forests and other ecosystems, as they've done in the past, it would transform an area twice the size of India. That, in turn, could make it impossible to keep climate change in check.Making things tougher, global warming is expected to put new stress on crops and reduce water supplies in many countries.One recent study by the World Resources Institute found that it's technically possible for the world to keep feeding everyone by 2050 without vast ecological destruction. But doing so would require a sweeping shift in agricultural practices -- involving everything from developing new technologies to simply wasting less food. How much is wasted? In the United States, about one-third of the food supply, according to the federal government.The first Earth Day was a defining moment in the great American experiment. Twenty million people nationwide -- at the time, roughly one in 10 citizens -- took part.You can see the descendents of Earth Day activism today in protests over fossil fuel infrastructure like the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock, or in the support for people like Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who last September helped inspire millions of people to march worldwide in protest of climate change.Last year the Pew Research Center reported that nearly 70 percent of Americans said the government was not doing enough to protect the water quality of lakes, rivers and streams, or to protect air quality. And this year, Pew reported that, for the first time in two decades, a majority of Americans believed dealing with climate change should be a top priority for the president and Congress, a 14-point rise from just four years ago.In the 1970s, environmentalism was overwhelmingly bipartisan.Democrats and Republicans worked together to create the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act and the E.P.A.Today that kind of teamwork seems all but unthinkable. While research by Pew shows that voters' interest in climate and environmental issues is soaring, it also reveals an astonishing split: More than 75 percent of Democrats called climate change a top policy priority, while less than 25 percent of Republicans did.Fossil fuel companies and political donors have funded denial of the overwhelming evidence for climate change, and the message has been successful with conservative politicians and voters. The Trump administration is trying to roll back regulations around climate change as well asbroader environmental measures.Still, there are some signs the split isn't as intractable as it seems.Renewable energy sources like wind and solar have been embraced in red states as well. Disasters fueled by climate change, such as flooding and wildfires, are forcing politicians to confront the reality of global warming. And voters are noticing: According to the Yale Program on Climate Change Communications, majorities of people surveyed in every congressional district in the country say that climate change is occurring.But perhaps the simplest reason to think the partisan divide could soften may be the younger generation. Some 52 percent of Republicans between 18 and 38 feel the government is doing too little on climate, Pew said last year, making the issue an electoral time bomb for the party.Whether that leads to a revival of bipartisan environmentalism is yet to be seen. For now, the coronavirus pandemic could well reshape nationalpriorities for a time. But when that disaster has passed, the fact remains: We're warming the world and without forceful action, the crisis will get worse.Additional photo credits: Bengal tiger, Navesh Chitrakar/Reuters; Gal"
