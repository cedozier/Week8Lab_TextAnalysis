"1","Article 1","July 15--Alabama Power Company is trying to beef up its ability to provide renewable energy in a bid to meet the demand of industries that require power from sources like wind, water and the sun.The company last month petitioned the Alabama Public Service Commission for authority to acquire up to 500 megawatts of renewable energy over the next six years, listing current and future customers as a main selling point.The company would either build  new equipment that would allow for renewable energy generation or buy such energy from other generators.""One of the things that we can be asked is what kind of offerings do you have as far as renewables,"" said Michael Sznajderman, an Alabama Power spokesman. ""We want to be able to provide these renewables.""The proposal, which was sent to the Public Service Commission on June 25th, would make Alabama more attractive to companies that want  or need renewable energy, Sznajderman said.""It could protect jobs, add jobs,"" he said. ""The more energy we sell, the better it is for our overall customer.""The news came out shortly after technology giant Google's June 25 announcement that it would build a new data center in Jackson County, where electricity is provided by the Tennessee Valley Authority. TVA's ability to provide renewable energy was important to Google's choice to come to Jackson County.""Google was very clear -- has been very clear --  that they want to power this new data center with renewable energy,"" said A.J. Jongewaard, a Google representative. ""They intend to power the facility with 100 percent renewable energy, and TVA was very receptive to that.""Sznajderman said Alabama Power's announcement wasn't in response to Google coming to Alabama in TVA territory, and that the dates were a coincidence.""We've been having conversations with our customers for some time about what their needs might be as far as renewables,"" he said.The proposal also mentioned military bases as important customers for this new energy. Federal guidelines are already in place that require renewable energy use at these bases, and Alabama Power hopes to meet that demand with this proposal, Sznajderman said.He also said the proposal would give Alabama Power plenty of latitude in the way it acquires this renewable energy.The plan outlines potential construction of permanent facilities, each of which would be restricted to generating no more than 80 megawatts of electricity, as well as the ability of the company to purchase energy from elsewhere.These deals are called Power Purchase Arrangements, and the company already uses them to bring in renewable energy from wind farms in the Midwest, Sznajderman said.""That's why the plan was written the way it was,"" he said. ""It gives us a wide latitude to figure out how to meet our customers' needs for renewables.""Some have criticized Alabama Power as being slow to move toward renewable energy, Sznajderman said. But there are several reasons for this, including that the company already had the resources it needed to meet its customers' demands, he said.""Unlike a lot of places ... we had no immediate need for additional generation,"" he said. ""We weren't in a mad rush ... We have always supported renewables where it makes sense to our customers.""The Public Service Commission has scheduled a public hearing on the proposal for Aug. 12. Anyone who wishes to intervene must send a petition to the commission by July 29.""We think we have a workable proposal,"" Sznajderman said. ""We're looking forward to the public hearing."""
"2","Article 2","After months of open speculation and exploratory meetings around the state, Miami state Sen. Annette Taddeo is making it official: she is running to be Florida's next governor.Taddeo, 54, filed campaign documents with Florida's Division of Elections on Monday morning. Her entry shakes up a Democratic field that has been so far dominated by two front-runners - U.S. Rep. Charlie Crist and Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried - as they vie to challenge Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2022.""We need a governor who will actually govern,"" Taddeo told the Herald in an interview last week. ""We clearly have someone that is more concerned about being president than he is about running Florida, more worried about Republican primary voters in Iowa than he is about families here in Florida.""Taddeo is the only non-white gubernatorial candidate among the top contenders,in a state where Hispanics make up nearly 27% of the population, according to the Census Bureau's latest release in 2020 - a growth that accounts for almost 1.5 million new Latinos in the past 10 years. If she were elected as the Democratic nominee, she would be the first Latina candidate to earn a major party nomination for Florida governor. And if Orlando-area U.S. Rep. Val Demings becomes Sen. Marco Rubio's Democratic challenger in 2022, Florida's minority party would top the midterm ballot with two women of color.Taddeo says she's running as the grassroots candidate. Her candidacy would be a milestone for a party that has struggled with messaging to Florida Latinos in the past several elections, something Taddeo says she's confident she will be able to overcome by speaking directly with Hispanic and African-American voters to create a ""winning coalition"" for Democrats.A major factor that weighed into her decision to run, she explains, is her belief that ""candidates need to reflect the coalition"" Democrats want to create. It's not enough for Latinas to be surrogates or running mates or campaign managers, she says. They need to be the ones running, too.""I love how people work so hard and say, 'We want minority votes' ... because they know that the coalition to win is a coalition of diverse voters across the state for Democrats, and certainly it's something that we haven't tried before."" Taddeo said. ""But for us [women of color]to dare to actually be at the front of the bus instead of the back of the bus is somehow aiming too high.""Taddeo, a working mother with a 15-year-old daughter and two adult stepdaughters, said parents won't forget DeSantis' months-long feud with local school board members and the Biden administration over implementing mandatory mask use policies in public schools.""As a parent, and from all the parents I've heard from, I don't think that's something you forget,"" Taddeo said. ""When politics comes to the point that it's actually affecting your kids, it's a whole different ball game.""Taddeo says Medicaid expansion in Florida and addressing climate change will be two major themes of her campaign over the next 10 months ahead of the state's Aug. 23 primary election. But above all, she said she wants to address the crisis of parents, especially women, who have left the workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic and haven't returned.""It has become more expensive for parents to figure out who's going to take care of their kid while they go to work, and if it costs more than what you make, it makes it really tough,"" said Taddeo, who owns a business that provides a range of language services called cqLanguageSpeak. ""I know that businesses are aware of this issue, and I think we as a state should start investing more in helping those parents with that childcare and earlier education.""She said she'd like to push for the expansion of Florida's Voluntary Pre-Kindergarten program, which currently provides a free pre-K education for three hours a day for kids under 4 years old,to run for a full day.'Anything is possible'Rumors of Taddeo's potential run began circulating earlier this year as she discussed the possibility with Democrats in the Florida Legislature, Miami-Dade County and Washington. She's been meeting with Hispanic leaders across the state, including in Central Florida.Taddeo is well-known in South Florida, where she's a frequent guest on Miami's Spanish-language radio stations and stumped for national Democrats campaigning on her home turf.She's irkedfellow Democrats more than once in openly criticizing her party's late outreach and investments for Florida Latinos and their positions on Latin America policy.""The people that are within the Democratic Party, where I have been with them in the trenches, the ones who knock on the door, the ones who work and make the phone calls and really try to help elect Democrats, I do know that many of them respect me because I'm willing to speak out when we are not doing something right,"" said Taddeo.But Taddeo is lesser known than Fried, the only Democrat elected statewide in Florida in 2020, and Crist, a former Republican governor of Florida who registered as a Democrat in 2012- and two years later chose Taddeo as his running mate during an ill-fated attempt to win his way back into the governor's mansion.""I think for Senator Taddeo to be successful, she's going to have to occupy a lane and also have to capture the imagination of the Democratic electorate through messaging and herself and her story,"" said Miami-based Democratic pollster Fernand Amandi. But he warned that Taddeo has just 10 months to raise money against two better-funded candidates.Earlier this month, Taddeo's political committee, Fight Back Florida PAC, announced a slate of consulting firms that have run research, polling, ads and mail programs with Democrats in battleground races across the country. And on Friday, the committee announced a group of new hires who've worked on progressive causes and campaigns in Florida, including Jackie Lee, Biden's Florida state director in 2020, and Millie Raphael, who worked as Senior Hispanic adviser for former gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum. But her committee reported less than $250,000 on hand last month, a fraction ofwhat Crist and Fried have available to spend.""But as we saw in 2018,"" Amandi said, referring to the surprise Democratic gubernatorial primary victory of Gillum, an under-funded and embattled candidate, ""anything is possible.""Taddeo, who represents Florida's Senate District 40 in West Miami-Dade County, was first elected to her seat in a 2017 special election triggered by the resignation of state Sen. Frank Artiles, after it emerged he used a racist slur while speaking to Black colleagues in the Florida capitol. Taddeo, a Colombian American, became the first Democratic Latina elected to the Florida Senate.Prior to that victory, Taddeo had endured a string of losses. She ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2008 and again in 2016, when former Congressman Joe Garcia beat her in the Democratic primary for Florida's 26th congressional district before losing in November to former U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo, a Republican. She lost a county commission race in 2010.Then in 2014, Taddeo was picked by her now-opponent Crist to be his running mate. That put her in position to become the state's first Latina lieutenant governor, a glass ceiling that was shattered four years later by Lt. Gov. Jeannette Nuñez.Crist choosing Taddeo helped - at least partially - to elevate her profile statewide. Previously a little-known business owner in Miami who wanted to improve her party's outreach of Latinos as the local chair of the Miami-Dade Democratic Party, she became a polished and formidable surrogate for Crist in Florida's Hispanic communities who was also taken seriously by Miami's Hispanic Republican leaders.""She's a remarkable woman and a classic American success story,"" Crist said in 2014 during his announcement. ""She truly is an American dream come true.""Though the bid was ultimately unsuccessful, headlines at the time describedTaddeo as an ""asset"" to Crist and an excellent fundraiser as he campaigned against the Republican incumbent, then-Gov. Rick Scott, whose lieutenant governor at the time was Carlos López-Cantera, a Cuban American from Miami-Dade.A Florida storyBorn in Barrancabermeja, Colombia in 1967, Taddeo fled to Alabama as a teenager with her family after her father, an Italian American from New Jersey, was briefly kidnapped by the Colombian FARC, a Marxist-Leninist guerrilla organization that Taddeo said had taken over her town and her family's farm.Still, she's not unfamiliar to attacks from Republicans calling her a communist. In the 2017 special state senate election, when her Republican opponent called her a sympathizer of socialist regimes in a campaign ad, Taddeo said she decided to be much more explicit about her background and her father's story.""It really was very upsetting, personally to me, to my mom,"" said Taddeo. ""One day I was shopping for uniforms for the next school year and the next day, I was in Alabama.""Taddeo hopes her ""Florida story"" will resonate with voters across the state.""My story is a story of believing in the American dream,"" she said. ""There's so many experiences in my life. Moving to Alabama and having to learn English but also living that very southern [life]in the Bible Belt of America and loving it, frankly.""Beyond a tough primary for Taddeo, Democrats are facing a scenario where they'll have to play catch-up with voter registration efforts, as Republicans ramp up their ground game.Democratshold an advantage of roughly 24,000 active, registered voters over Republicans. Little more thana decade ago, registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans in Florida by more than 500,000.Another issue for Democrats in the general election is addressing the swell of support that Republicans gained among Hispanic supporters throughout Florida in 2020, especially in Miami-Dade County.""Clearly, it's concerning,"" Taddeo said. ""But we also need to have the right people speaking to those voters about what it means to be a Democrat, why they should register Democrats, why they should vote for Democrats in a way that actually brings them towards us.""Fried and Crist have both been making early investments with Hispanic communities by meeting with leaders in the Cuban, Colombian, Puerto Rican and Venezuelan communities around the state.Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a former Miami congresswoman who was the first South-American immigrant to serve in Congress, said she considers Fried, Crist and Taddeo to be good friends and she hasn't endorsed anyone in the race.But she did say she recognized the importance of Taddeo jumping into the gubernatorial race.""I really think that we need more Hispanic women in positions of power,"" said Mucarsel-Powell. ""The Hispanic vote is going to be extremely important in 2022 and all election cycles and the candidate that can speak to the Hispanic community the best is going to have a better chance of moving them and getting them to turn out in the future election."""
"3","Article 3","President Joe Biden is entering a crucial two weeks for his ambitious agenda, racing to conclude contentious congressional negotiations ahead of both domestic deadlines and a chance to showcase his administration's accomplishments on a global stage.Biden and his fellow Democrats are struggling to bridge intraparty divides by month's end to pass  and . The president hopes to nail down both before Air Force One lifts off for Europe on Oct. 28 for a pair of world leader summits, including the most ambitious climate change meeting in years.Biden is trying to stabilize his presidency after a difficult stretch marked by , a diplomatic spat with a longtime ally and a surge in COVID-19 cases that rattled the nation's economic recovery and .The president's goals have been jeopardized by fractures among Democrats, imperiling the fate of promised sweeping new efforts to grapple with . There's also rising anxiety within the party about  and looming Senate fights over  and government funding that could distract from getting the president's agenda across the finish line.Biden's team has continued its strategy - one that served it well during the campaign and earlier this year - of blocking out the outside noise to stay focused on a singular mission, this time to pass the two-part package that will give Democrats a platform on which to run in next year's midterm elections.""These bills, in my view, are literally about competitiveness versus complacency, about opportunity versus decay, and about leading the world or continuing to let the world move by us.""""These bills, in my view, are literally about competitiveness versus complacency, about opportunity versus decay, and about leading the world or continuing to let the world move by us,"" Biden said Friday while pushing the legislation in Connecticut.Yet beneath the White House's pleas for patience - reminding people that hard things take time - is a bubbling sense of urgency that a deal needs to be struck rapidly.For the White House, there are the explicit target dates, including an end-of-month deadline on transportation funding and Biden's upcoming foreign trip. But there are also more abstract imperatives: proving Democrats can deliver on their promises to voters and protecting Biden's waning political capital.President Biden has expressed impatience and will be increasing his own personal outreach this week to pressure lawmakers to find a compromise and bring the bills to a vote.With new urgency, the administration has sent signals to Capitol Hill in recent days that it is time to wrap up negotiations, that a deal needs to be reached, according to two White House officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations. Biden himself has expressed impatience and will be increasing his own personal outreach this week to push lawmakers to find a compromise and bring the bills to a vote, the officials said.West Wing officials are still optimistic that an agreement will ultimately be struck, but there are also fears that the messy, drawn-out negotiation has clouded the tangible benefits of what Biden aims to deliver to voters.Biden sought to address some of that when he traveled to Hartford, Connecticut, last week to showcase initiatives to sharply reduce the cost of early childhood care - perhaps one of the only pieces of the legislation that is a lock to make the final package.Even Democratic leaders are divided on the best way to shrink the overall price tag of the package in order to win over more votes. Biden said Friday he prefers including all of the wish-list proposals, but trimming down the length of the programs to cut costs. His thinking is that a future Congress can vote later to extend programs that the American people will find popular.But days earlier, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested the opposite tack - approving a narrower set of programs to last for a longer time period.Some Democrats have pushed for passing the bipartisan infrastructure deal by Oct. 31 even if the larger social services package is not settled, a move many progressives dislike because they could lose leverage for the latter bill.The fate of climate change provisions is particularly perilous.West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin's objections to a program aimed at speeding the nation's transition away from fossil fuels threatens the heart of Biden's plans to combat climate change just before he tries to assert American leadership on the issue at the upcoming global conference in Scotland.The Democrats' razor-thin margins in both houses of Congress have empowered individual lawmakers like Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, vexing fellow lawmakers and the White House. White House aides have not abandoned the clean energy program but are exploring alternate means to string together a mix of policies to cut emissions, officials said.Abandoning the provisions could wound Biden in Glasgow, at a summit that the administration has held out as a vital opportunity not just to combat climate change but to reassert U.S. leadership on the issue after four years of retrenchment under President Donald Trump. The United States will be bringing a major footprint to the gathering - including former President Barack Obama - but it risks falling behind European nations that have taken more concrete steps to cut emissions.Biden's stop in Scotland early in November will follow his participation in a summit of world leaders in Rome. But Chinese President Xi Jinping's decision to skip the gatherings - delaying the first meeting between the leaders of the two superpowers - could diminish their relevance.Still, Biden is expected to meet in Italy with French President Emmanuel Macron as the men look to repair relations after a U.S. submarine deal with Australia scuttled a French contract and led the French to briefly withdraw their ambassador from Washington.Also looming is the Nov. 2 gubernatorial election in Virginia, which is regarded as a referendum on Biden and the Democrats' chances of retraining control over Congress next year.Terry McAuliffe, who previously served as the state's governor, is locked in a closer-than-expected race with Republican businessman Glenn Youngkin in a state that Biden won by 10 points last year.McAuliffe has been surprisingly public in his criticism of the administration's legislative strategy, urging Democrats to pass the infrastructure bill before Election Day to give him something to show voters. White House officials privately expect McAuliffe to emerge with a narrow win and believe they can ignore worries about a smaller-than-expected margin of victory.But a tight outcome, or a Youngkin win, could rattle Democrats uncertain about Biden's political coattails - potentially making them less likely to take risky votes for his agenda - and would buoy Republicans heading into the midterms."
"4","Article 4","Anne Arundel County continues to have unhealthy levels of air pollution, posing health risks to sensitive residents, according to a report issued today.The American Lung Association gave the county a grade of F for smog and D for soot pollution in its annual ""State of the Air"" report. Anne Arundel also squeaked out a ""pass"" on a pass/fail measurement of year-round soot pollution.Overall, the Baltimore-Washington metro area ranks 14th-worst nationally both for daily smog pollution and daily soot pollution.The lung association report measures two types of pollution: smog, also known as ground-level ozone; and soot, also called particulate matter. The report issued today covered the years 2005 to 2007 and is based on government data.Ozone occurs when hot air, sunshine and airborne pollutants combine. Ozone contributes to decreased lung function, respiratory infections, lung inflammation and worsening of lung problems.Particulate matter, tiny bits of solid and liquid pollution in the air, also causes health warnings and health problems, including increased hospital visits for asthma and heart patients, according to the lung association.""Air pollution is serious,"" said Dr. Norman H. Edelman, chief medical officer for the lung association.Air pollution is caused by emissions from gasoline and diesel vehicles, coal-burning power plants and other sources.Despite the poor grades, state environment officials said Maryland's air pollution is decreasing.""We've made some progress, but we still have a ways to go,"" said Tad Aburn, the top air-quality official at the state Department of the Environment. ""The reality is, the air Marylanders breathe is a whole bunch cleaner than 10 years ago.""Aburn, who was attending a multistate meeting about power-plant pollution yesterday, said Maryland needs to continue to cut down on pollution from local sources as well as work with neighboring states. On some days, 50 percent to 70 percent of Maryland's air pollution blows in from the Ohio Valley.Maryland lawmakers have taken steps to combat air pollution.The Healthy Air Act, passed in 2006, requires pollution controls at power plants, some of which already have been installed. And the Clean Cars Act of 2007 will eventually require more low-emissions cars to be sold here.Those laws and other programs should result in better pollution scores in the future, Aburn said.Charles D. Conner, CEO of the lung association, said the report underscores the importance of fighting air pollution, even as the nation wrestles with other urgent, related issues such as global warming and energy independence.""We still must recognize the problems we have with old-fashioned air pollution,"" he said.The report mainly looks at how often air quality alerts such as ""code orange"" and ""code red"" are issued to warn sensitive people to stay inside because of high levels of soot or smog. Those alerts are issued mostly in the summer, when hot air and sunlight make the effects of pollution worse.The lung association offered ideas for improving air quality: require pollution controls at coal-burning power plants, clean up the nation's diesel trucks and buses, clean up dirty oceangoing ships, and tighten pollution regulations.Individuals can take action by driving less and using less electricity, not burning wood or trash, lobbying for cleaner buses, and getting involved in pollution policy, officials said.This is the 10th year for the ""State of the Air"" report, which initially gave grades only for smog. Soot was added later.If you're looking for a place with air that's easier to breathe, the lung association says Fargo, N.D., has the cleanest air in the nation. How we rank:The American Lung Association annually ranks cities, counties and regions on air quality. The rankings are based on data collected by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The 2009 report is based on data from 2005 to 2007.Here's how Anne Arundel County scored:SMOGOzoneGrade: F48 code orange days, 2 code red days, 1 code purple day.Weighted score: 17.7, fifth-worst in Maryland.SOOTShort-term particle pollutionGrade: D7 code orange daysWeighted score: 2.3, fourth-worst in Maryland.ANNUAL PARTICLE POLLUTIONGrade: PassScore: 14.3 (15 or greater is failing), third worst in Maryland.Queen Anne's County is not ranked because it does not have an air-quality monitoring station."
"5","Article 5","Dec. 11--Drought conditions have dried out the North Fork of the Edisto River but Orangeburg Department of Public Utilities officials say the situation has yet to reach a critical point.DPU, which is a primary source of drinking water for the city and surrounding environs, is keeping an eye on low water levels.""The drought is bad for everybody,"" DPU manager Fred Boatwright said. ""We are certainly concerned about the drought but the river level right now is not a problem for us.""Boatwright said in his experience the river tends to fall to a plateau level in which it holds steady through the support of groundwater.""We are still in good shape,"" Boatwright said. ""But I still want it to rain. If I could do a rain dance I would.""Through Dec. 7, the Edisto River elevation was 153.1 feet above sea level, which is about two feet above, the 85-year record low.The level is up from 152.4 feet seen in October and up 152.1 feet above sea level in June. The lowest the river has ever been is 151.5 feet during the last drought in August 2002.Stream flows this past week along the Edisto through the city were around 172 million gallons. During the severe drought in 2002, the flow was averaging about 90 million gallons.The utility requires about 8.5 million gallons a day to provide an adequate water supply for its customers.DPU spokesman Randy Etters said the utility monitors stream flows daily with the utility having a benchmark in place when the river reaches a level of about 151.6 feet above sea level and stream flows less than 125 cubit feet per second.The ordinance is based upon the South Carolina Drought Response Act issued by the Department of Natural Resources and consistent with the state's water plan.""We have been very fortunate,"" Etters said. ""Our equipment has been functioning properly and well within the tolerance level.""The Friends of the Edisto, a river advocacy group, during its monthly meeting Thursday night at the Orangeburg Fatz Cafe expressed its concerns about the falling river levels.""The water table is now below the river so the river is now recharging the water table,"" said Bill Marshall, acting chair of FRED.South Carolina Department of Natural Resources hydrologists estimate the river is losing about 60 percent of its water where the North Fork and the South Forks meet.In an article appearing in the Dec. 2 edition of The State, DNR chief hydrologist Bud Badr says the underground water table appears to be sinking into the ground in part due to the impact of the drought about five years ago.He says usually the downstream volume of the Edisto is much greater than the sum of its upstream branches with the volume increasing as small tributaries join the river and the water table also seeps water into the Edisto.Badr said the phenomena is not typical for inland systems like the Edisto.Tim Rogers, founding FRED member, inquired if there were any proposals or legislation underway to help permit or restrict withdrawals from the river.""One of the good things about the Edisto is that historically there have not been a lot of withdrawal points,"" he said, noting that what happens to withdrawal levels when a drought is in place. ""A least it would be nice if we had some set of rules.""Rogers, who has a residence by the river, said 'you can't put a boat in and you can't move it up and down the river.""""Fishing is down,"" he said.Fish biologists with DNR have said water levels have resulted in reduced fish habitats that could lead to reduced fish populations if adequate winter and spring rains do not arrive.The National Drought Mitigation Drought Monitor Index through Dec. 4 revealed most of Orangeburg County is in a severe drought with the exception of the western end of the county around Springfield which is classified as in an extreme drought.The ranking is the third level of drought severity on a scale of five, with five classified as an exceptional drought.The town of North and Eutawville have a voluntary water restriction issued Oct. 31 and Nov. 12, respectively, according to the DNR Water Conservation Web site.The Silver Springs Water District also issued a voluntary restriction on Sept. 7.Most of Calhoun County is also in the severe category, with the exception of the Sandy Run area near Columbia, which is classified as extreme. There are no water restriction advisories in Calhoun County.In Bamberg County, the index revealed most of the county in a severe drought, with the exception of the Denmark area, which is extreme.According to the DNR Web site, the most recent water restrictions include the town of Govan which has a voluntary water restriction.The South Carolina Drought Response Committee, made up of various state and local agencies, monitors the drought conditions, and convenes when deemed necessary if more rain or the lack of causes a change in water conditions.In the meantime, DNR is encouraging all to conserve water during this time.Statewide, the Piedmont area has been hit by the drought most extensively, while the coastal plain near Hilton Head and Beaufort is classified as a moderate drought.Overall, things do not look any better for the Southeast.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasts the region likely will remain drier than average because of La Nina, while temperatures are expected to be above average through the winter.La Nina is defined as cooler-than-normal sea-surface temperatures in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean that impact global weather patterns. La Nina conditions recur every few years and can persist for as long as two years."
"6","Article 6","Skeptics about global warming often focus on computer models of the world's climate, criticizing the models as inaccurate and contradictory. $TSurprisingly, scientists agree. Even the most powerful and sophisticated model, they say, produces only an educated guess about the climate of the future. For that reason, scientists stress that models do not produce predictions. They prefer the term ""scenarios."" $T""Scenarios are plausible alternative futures --- each an example of what might happen under particular assumptions,"" U.S. scientists cautioned in a report released in April. ""Scenarios are not specific predictions or forecasts."" $TMost computer scenarios agree that if the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubles as expected by the end of the century, the gas will serve like a pane of glass in a greenhouse, trapping solar heat that otherwise would escape into space. But the models disagree on the details, including how much warming is likely. $TReflecting that range, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, made up of hundreds of scientists from around the world, this year predicted a temperature rise of 2.5 to 10.4 degrees by the end of the century. $TModeling the climate is difficult because of the interaction of many factors: ocean currents; jet streams; cloud cover; solar activity; airborne particles; and physical features such as mountains and deserts, just for starters. Climate modelers try to mimic that complex interaction in a supercomputer. $TThe models are tested for accuracy by matching them up against history. The computer is asked to project the climate for a certain time frame, and the results are compared with the climate that actually occurred.AJC$TIf there's a discrepancy, modelers go back to the drawing board. $TIn April, the National Science and Technology Council, a panel of American scientists, released a report on the possible impact of global warming on the United States. To their chagrin, the scientists were forced to rely on models developed by scientists at the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research in Britain and the Canadian Centre for Climate Modeling and Analysis in Victoria, British Columbia. $TU.S.-based models simply weren't as sophisticated and accurate, in large part because of inadequate government funding. In a subsequent report, the National Academy of Sciences told President Bush that ""the ability of the United States to assess future climate change is severely limited by … inadequate computational resources, and by the general inability of government to focus resources on climate problems."" $TIn parts of the country, the Hadley and Canadian models are in rough agreement. But they disagree dramatically about the Southeast. The Hadley model projects a warmer and slightly wetter future, with serious but manageable impacts; the Canadian model projects a much warmer and drier climate, with almost calamitous effects. $T""We really don't know what will happen in the future,"" says Shrikent Jagtap, a researcher at the University of Florida trying to assess the impact of climate change on agriculture in the Southeast.

In this case, when the Canadian and Hadley computer models projected the annual average temperature in the United States from 1961 to 1990 (below left), they predicted outcomes similar to what took place.Three maps show the projected annual average temperature in the United States according to the observed climate and computer models:Observed climate, 1961-90 averageCanadian climate model, 1961-90 averageHadley climate model, 1961-90 average Map:TEMPERATURE RISINGIn the 20th century, temperatures in the United States remained largely steady, with a cooling of about 1 degree in the Southeast.

As a result, the July heat index --- a figure that combines heat and humidity and reflects how hot it feels --- rises 8 to 15 degrees in the Hadley model and 25 degrees or more in the Canadian model.Two maps show the projected annual heat index in the United States according to computer models:Canadian heat index model, 2100Hadley heat index model, 2100 Map:LESS PRECIPITATIONWith hotter weather and increased evaporation, rainfall becomes increasingly critical for the survival of plants and aquatic life. The Canadian model projects a slight decline in rainfall, which, combined with much hotter temperatures, would dry the soil and greatly reduce water in Southeast streams. The Hadley model projects a small increase in rainfall, resulting in small declines in soil moisture.Two maps show the projected annual precipitation in the United States according to computer models:Canadian precipitation model, 2100Hadley precipitation model, 2100 Map:WITH FEWER TREES, GEORGIA MORE LIKE TEXAS?The Southeast, including Georgia, is dominated by a mixed forest of pines and hardwoods (bottom left). If temperatures rise and rainfall drops, as suggested in the Canadian model, most of the state's coastal plain changes to open grassland much like that of Texas or Nebraska. Most of the northwest third of the state changes to a savanna-woodland mix similar to that of North Florida. According to the Hadley model, there would be warmer temperatures but more rain, and therefore little change in the ecosystem.Three maps show the curent and projected ecosystmes in the United States according to computer models:Current ecosystemsCanadian ecosystems model, 2100Hadley ecosystems model, 2100The ecosystems displayed are:TundraTaiga/tundraConifer forestNortheast mixed forestTemperate deciduous forestSoutheast mixed forestTropical broadleaf forestSavanna/woodlandShrub/woodlandGrasslandArid landsSource: Mapped Atmosphere-Plant-Soil System, a computer model developed by Ron Neilson of the U.S. Forest Service.

If global warming occurs as scientists expect, even the most mountainous Georgia streams would be too warm to sustain the fish.Other native speciesOther species native to the state would also be at risk. Along the Georgia coast, rising sea levels threaten beaches on barrier islands where endangered sea turtles lay their eggs. Coastal marshes, which help sustain wading birds such as storks and egrets as well as migratory birds, also would be endangered by the rising sea.The pine forests of South and Middle Georgia are home to a variety of endangered and threatened species, including the red-cockaded woodpecker (right), the indigo snake and the gopher tortoise. If rainfall in the region falls 20 percent, as projected in the Canadian climate model, those pineforest ecosystems and the species they sustain would disappear from the state and perhaps from the planet.MapBROOK TROUT HABITATPresent distribution of brook troutReduced range because of warmingSource: Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences Graphic:TIMBER AND FORESTRYManaged forestsTree growers can manipulate fertilizer levels, tree genetics and other factors to help managed forests cope with the impact of global warming.Natural forestsForests growing naturally would be much more vulnerable to drought, pests and other consequences of global warming. Graphic:AGRICULTUREGeorgia farmers would have to adapt to longer periods of drought interspersed with more intense rainfall. But if rainfall declines significantly, the state's farm economy would probably collapse. Graphic:RISING SEA THREATENS COASTLINEIf sea levels rise as expected along the Georgia coast, policymakers will have two options. If they allow the process to occur naturally, the state's coastline will move inland by an average of 100 to 200 yards. Beaches and marshes would rebuild themselves naturally along the new coastline.That policy would be politically controversial because it allows the destruction of private property along the coast. However, it would preserve the beaches that draw hundreds of thousands of tourists to the region and the marshes that sustain the entire coastal ecosystem.The second approach, called armoring, would protect private property from the encroaching ocean because sea walls and bulkheads would be built along the coast. Under that approach, however, beaches and marshes would be trapped between a rising ocean and man-made structures and would all but disappear. The Georgia shoreline would become a long line of rocks and concrete protecting the interior from the ocean.According to either approach, the state's barrier islands and coastal areas would become more vulnerable to storms. Homes and businesses now protected from a storm surge would be flooded if sea levels rose by 2 feet.Diagram illustrates the effect of a rise in sea level of 2 feetGEORGIA'S CHANGING COAST (Not to scale)As the sea level rises and the marshes are flooded, coastal structures such as roads keep the marshes from moving inland.Coastal marshes provide a nursery for many types of sea life, including commercially important species such as shrimp. Birds, crabs, raccoons and larger fish also use the marshes as feeding grounds.The loss of beach and rising water levels make structures on barrier islands more vulnerable to huge waves during tropical storms and hurricanes.A rise of 20 inches in sea level would result in the destruction of the beaches along Georgia's barrier islands.Barrier islandCurrent beachMarshlandMainlandMarshlandRoadbedArmored beachStorm surgeAtlantic OceanIntracoastal WaterwayCurrent sea levelProjected 20-inch rise in sea level Photo:CHANGING ECOSYSTEMIf precipitation in Georgia drops 20 percent by 2030 as predicted in the Canadian climate model, the forests of South and Central Georgia would begin to die back because of drought.

Those fires eventually would transform that region into open grasslands much like those of the Great Plains (right). Photo:"
"7","Article 7","Fewer tornadoes, lakes you can wade across, earlier springs and longer growing seasons - obviously, global warming has come to Oklahoma. Right?Well, perhaps.  But whether all this stuff was caused by worldwide climate change, who knows? For one thing, nothing's for sure in science.""We don't even know for certain that the sun's going to rise tomorrow,"" David Karoly said.Before you stock up on flashlights, remember that scientists tend to be very conservative. Science is the practice of observing what you can, then drawing conclusions that best explain those observations. Take that sun thing, for instance. From what scientists have learned to this point, most are confident enough to bet their bottom dollar that the sun will come up tomorrow.""It's very likely to,"" said Karoly, University of Oklahoma meteorologist who studies climate change.Also, as a recent report from a United Nations panel on climate change stated, scientists worldwide are confident - maybe not to the level of the sunrise theory, but pretty darn sure - that the Earth is getting warmer. Also, they say, it's ""very likely"" that greenhouse gas emissions produced by people are the cause.Still, it's not clear whether global warming or just normal fluctuations in climate are causing various changes in Oklahoma lately. That's because it's hard to tell what causes small-scale things over short periods, scientists say. By ""small-scale"" in the global sense, scientists mean things happening over one state or even a region, and by ""short periods,"" they mean within a few years.For changes happening over decades or longer and over large areas, such as the entire country or the continent and during the past 30 years or more, it's different. ""We can say with high confidence that the warming average across North America is due to increased greenhouse gases,"" Karoly said.Meanwhile, many other scientists and naturalists are noting changes in animal behavior or plant growth on the small scale. But tying those to global warming? That's another thing.Craig Davis has been closely watching birds, particularly migrating shorebirds passing through western Oklahoma. Ponds, bogs, swamps and lakes across the Great Plains form ""steppingstones of wetlands"" that the birds follow, providing vital stops on their long journeys north, he said.But for whatever reason, a changing climate has been drying up many of those ""white dots"" birds search for along their flyways, said Davis, assistant professor of wildlife conservation at Oklahoma State University. ""We don't want to lose any more steppingstones.""I wouldn't say we're seeing great, great changes,"" he said. ""But the concern is we are starting to see the beginnings of some of these changes.""Allan Storjohann has noticed many tropical ornamental plants doing fine here. Not long ago, those plants could not survive Oklahoma's winters. Yet, some agave, yuccas and palms that once were rarely seen north of Dallas have become favorites of landscapers across this state, he said. ""We're seeing plants we thought might be killed out there.""But even that apparently is no indication of warming, the global kind anyway. Sure, summers around here lately have been warmer, just like winters in recent years, except for the current one. But those, too, could be normal fluctuations of temperature, researchers say. More easily attributed to planetary warming, Karoly said, would be the ""quite pronounced"" warming trend in Oklahoma over the past few decades.""Earlier springs, fewer frosts, warmer nighttime temperatures - those sorts of things have been happening with greater regularity or with greater magnitude over the last 30 years,"" Karoly said.Oklahoma's tropical plant influx also might be just that breeders have developed hardier versions, said Storjohann, ornamental horticulturist and manager of the Myriad Botanical Gardens. ""They're new selections of plants,"" he said.Joseph Bidwell has seen some zebra mussels disappearing from Skiatook Lake, not that he's sorry to see these invasive mollusks go. But it appears the recent warmer temperatures and low water flows have taken a toll on the annoying bivalves, said Bidwell, associate professor of zoology at OSU.""Is that due to global warming?"" he asked. ""I can't say.""Data from much longer periods would be needed to determine that, he said.Scientists can hypothesize (science-speak for making an educated guess) about what might be expected if global warming progresses as it's expected to. Plants would, as it appears they have been doing lately, tend to bloom earlier and have longer growing seasons. For some people, a slight warming could be profitable, Karoly said. Farmers, for instance, particularly those in the Northern Plains, could plant earlier and enjoy longer growing seasons.""If temperatures continue to rise, if rainfall patterns change, there may be added problems,"" he said.Scientists expect continued global warming to push the jet stream and the main rainfall-bearing systems northward, making that region wetter and more prone to storm activity than the Southern Plains. However, Oklahoma's recent dry spell and drop in tornado activity could be just natural fluctuations in weather, scientists say.If those local patterns continue over many years, researchers might be able to tie them to global warming, Karoly said.Meanwhile, researchers will continue watching and measuring and observing. And the public will keep wondering and asking why things are happening in their state - even if it's hard for scientists to bet their bottom dollar on a clear explanation. Bidwell hopes people don't assume that because scientists don't have ""absolute, definitive"" answers to all questions, global warming isn't happening or isn't a problem.""That's what the frustration is,"" he said."
"8","Article 8","Feb. 11--A special team at Owensboro Municipal Utilities studying solar options for producing or obtaining electricity is scheduled to present its findings to the utility's board on Thursday, but Aloma Dew is being careful not to set her hopes too high.""I have not seen a lot of enthusiasm from OMU for sustainable and renewable energy,"" said Dew, a representative of the local Sierra Club and a long-time environmental activist. ""I hope I'll be pleasantly surprised. But I fear OMU is going with natural gas. It's cleaner than coal, but frankly it is not sustainable or renewable. But in the short term, it may be necessary.""A shift to natural gas generation of electricity figures to be expensive, Dew said, and she fears that will mean the utility will not be able to also invest in renewable energy, such as solar.""I think the most reasonable expectation is that they will do a mix and begin to move toward sustainable-renewable energy,"" Dew said. ""We are all anxious to hear what they have to say.""Dew said she plans to invite OMU General Manager Terry Naulty to attend the local Sierra Club's meeting in March to talk to the membership about OMU's plans to include renewable resources in its energy portfolio.One option for OMU may be to lease solar energy capacity, Dew said.Sonya Dixon, OMU's spokeswoman, said the plan remains for the solar study team to makes its report at the 11:30 a.m. meeting of the City Utility Commission on Thursday. The meeting, which is open to the public, will be held at the OMU Customer Service Center, 2070 Tamarack Road.Based on its most recent staff recommendation, OMU appears on the verge of severing its ties to coal-fired generation and adopting natural gas as its main fuel for generating electricity, either by building its own natural gas power plant or by partnering with an existing or new natural gas utility. But the utility is looking at ways to incorporate renewable energy, namely solar, into its generation portfolio.In late December, Naulty said the solar team was assigned to evaluate three potential solar generation options.""The three options include: 1, self-development of a solar facility; 2, building a community solar project in which customers could lease solar panels from OMU and use the energy generated to offset their energy use consistent with OMU's net metering tariff; and 3, contracting with a third party to build a solar facility which would be owned by private equity and from which OMU would purchase the energy and capacity under a long-term power purchase agreement.""For all three options, the team will be providing an assessment of integration costs and the potential electric rate increases to customers if the Utility Commission and Owensboro City Commission were to approve, said Naulty.Naulty said that while the cost of solar energy continues to drop, it is still more expensive than conventional energy production methods.Austin McLimore, OMU's manager of engineering, is leading the solar team.In early December, the OMU staff recommended to the OMU board that the utility eventually cease coal-fired generation at the Elmer Smith Station power plant, based on a study that concluded that continuing to burn coal at the plant on Kentucky 144 will no longer be the most economical method of producing power in the face of ever-climbing regulatory costs associated with coal-fired generation and the availability of abundant, relatively cheap, cleaner-burning natural gas. Since then, the board ordered an outside review of the study's findings."

"11","Article 11","Whether or not climate change leads to an increase in big hurricanes, one destructive effect of global warming is already at work in coastal Virginia -- rising sea levels.As sea levels go up, flooding from even low-level storms will become more destructive, scientists say.""At times I think we get too locked in on the strongest storms, the Category 3, 4 and 5s,"" said Marshall Shepherd, a University of Georgia atmospheric scientist. ""But if you look at the last five or 10 years, even the weaker storms can create a lot more damage.""Hurricane Isabel is a perfect example of this growing threat. To understand this, we need to look first at another storm.The worst hurricane to hit southeastern Virginia in modern times was a 1933 storm whose center rolled northwest directly over Norfolk. It was a Category 1 hurricane, with winds reported at nearly 90 mph.Called the Chesapeake-Potomac hurricane, the legendary storm pushed up record high tides along the west side of the Chesapeake Bay, ""with damages the highest ever recorded from a storm surge,"" according to the state Department of Emergency Management website. Eighteen people died.Isabel in 2003, the center of which traveled northwest through central Virginia, weakened from a hurricane to a tropical storm about the time it hit the state, but it still caused $1.6 billion in damage, destroying homes, piers and other structures and contributing to more than 30 deaths in the state.While less powerful overall than the '33 hurricane, Isabel caused similar flooding because the sea level had risen 9 to 10 inches in the years between the two storms, scientists said.That gave Isabel extra destructive power, enabling it to push its storm surge inland on higher waters.As sea levels continue to rise, bad coastal flooding should get more common, said Larry P. Atkinson, an Old Dominion University oceanographer.""What statistically happened every 100 years will happen every 80, then 50, then 20 and so on,"" Atkinson said.Sea-level rise is caused at least in part by global warming, because warm water expands. In Virginia, sea levels are rising faster than the global average because the land is sinking, primarily from natural causes.For thousands of years, the sea level in Virginia went up about a foot a century. At least partly because of global warming, experts say, that rate increased during the 20th century, and waters are rising now at about a 2-feet-a-century clip. And some scientists say there's evidence that sea levels will rise faster and faster in coming decades.Celia and Jim Sease have a house along Mobjack Bay in low-lying Mathews County. Floodwaters from Isabel lapped at a door of their home, and the storm ""pretty much destroyed"" a nearby vacation rental house they owned at the time, flooding it with about 2feet of water, Celia Sease said.Sease said she can't detect the rising sea level, but she has noticed an apparent increase in flooding in recent years. ""I don't know what the reason is. ... It just seems like there's a lot more flooding now from just normal rains.""Flooding is indeed getting worse in coastal Virginia, said a January report from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science.For example, a low-lying Norfolk neighborhood called the Hague, which flooded fewer than 25 hours a year in the late 1920s, flooded 200 to 300 hours a year in the mid- to late 2000s.Also, people continue to build near Virginia's coast, putting themselves and their property at risk.Doug Dwoyer, a former NASA manager who lectures on climate change, said that coastal buildup means ""economic damage from hurricanes will continue to increase even without increases in hurricane strength and/or frequency."""
"12","Article 12","Rising sea levels are expected to impact $916 billion worth of homes in the next 0 years, most of which are low-end or median-value homes.Zillow analyzed the types of homes that could be underwater, absent preventative measures, based on recent estimates of how high sea levels could rise by 20 due to climate change.The majority of all homes at risk of flooding due to rising sea levels are in suburban areas  65.4 percent of homes are in suburban areas, compared to 22.6 percent in urban locations and 12 percent in rural areas.Overall, 39 percent of the homes expected to be underwater in 20 are among the nation's most valuable. The rest are near the median value or below  and a quarter are among the least valuable homes. This is significant because less wealthy communities and households are less likely to be able to afford preventative measures to ward off rising seas. For most homeowners, a home is their biggest single investment, and its value is a major share of their overall wealth. Any significant damage to a home is harder to recover from when most of an owner's wealth is tied up in that same home.Owners of high-end homes are more likely to live in communities with the resources and connections needed to protect their homes, such as building sea walls or making structural changes that help homes withstand floodwaters. But in markets where the majority of homes at risk of rising water are among the least valuable in the area, these options might be out of reach.Less than 20 percent of homes in Honolulu that are at risk of flooding due to rising sea levels are high-end homes. That means the majority of homeowners who could lose their homes may be less able to make investments to protect their properties, especially lower income homeowners who have to spend a larger share of their income on mortgage payments.""We've seen the enormous impact flooding can have on a city and its residents,"" said Zillow Chief Economist Dr. Svenja Gudell. ""It's harder for us to think about it on a long-term timeline, but the real risks that come with rising sea levels should not be ignored until it's too late to address them. With organized and committed planning, cities can help protect both current and future residents. Living near the water is incredibly appealing for people around the country, but it also comes with additional considerations for buyers and homeowners. Homes in low-lying areas are also more susceptible to storm flooding and these risks could be realized on a much shorter timeline as we have seen time and time again.""Miami holds 25.8 percent of all U.S. homes at risk of rising sea levels, which are cumulatively worth $217.3 billion. The three cities with the greatest number of homes threatened by higher sea levels are in the Miami metropolitan area. Fort Lauderdale, Miami Beach and Miami could all lose more than 30,000 homes to sea level increases."
"13","Article 13","By Seth Borenstein The Associated PressWASHINGTON - Melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are speeding up the already fast pace of sea level rise, new satellite research shows.At the current rate, the world's oceans on average will be at least 2 feet higher by the end of the century compared to today, according to researchers who published in Monday's Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences.Sea level rise is caused by warming of the ocean and melting from glaciers and ice sheets. The research, based on 25 years of satellite data, shows that pace has quickened, mainly from the melting of massive ice sheets. It confirms scientists' computer simulations and is in line with predictions from the United Nations, which releases regular climate change reports.""It's a big deal because the projected sea level rise is a conservative estimate and it is likely to be higher, said lead author Steve Nerem of the University of Colorado.Outside scientists said even small changes in sea levels can lead to flooding and erosion.""Any flooding concerns that coastal communities have for 2100 may occur over the next few decades, Oregon State University coastal flooding expert Katy Serafin said in an email.Of the 3 inches of sea level rise in the past quarter century, about 55 percent is from warmer water expanding, and the rest is from melting ice.But the process is accelerating, and more than three-quarters of that acceleration since 1993 is due to melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, the study shows.Like weather and climate, there are two factors in sea level rise: year-to-year small rises and falls that are caused by natural events and larger long-term rising trends that are linked to man-made climate change.Nerem's team removed the natural effects of the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption that temporarily chilled Earth and the climate phenomena El Nino and La Nina, and found the accelerating trend.Sea level rise, more than temperature, is a better gauge of climate change in action, said Anny Cazenave, director of Earth science at the International Space Science Institute in France, who edited the study. Cazenave is one of the pioneers of space-based sea level research.Global sea levels were stable for about 3,000 years until the 20th century when they rose and then accelerated due to global warming caused by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, said climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute in Germany, who wasn't part of the study.Two feet of sea level rise by the end of the century ""would have big effects on places like Miami and New Orleans, but I don't still view that as catastrophic because those cities can survive - at great expense - that amount of rising seas under normal situations, Nerem said.But when a storm hits like 2012's Superstorm Sandy, sea level rise on top of storm surge can lead to record-setting damages, researchers said.Some scientists at the American Geophysical Union meeting last year said Antarctica may be melting faster than predicted by Monday's study.Greenland has caused three times more sea level rise than Antarctica so far, but ice melt on the southern continent is responsible for more of the acceleration.""Antarctica seems less stable than we thought a few years ago, Rutgers climate scientist Robert Kopp said."
"14","Article 14","Oct. 11—A new study from the Environment Texas Research & Policy Center concludes that the Brownsville-Harlingen metropolitan statistical area had the most days of polluted air in the state last year, at least in terms of how many days the region's two particulate monitors detected what the report's authors characterize as elevated levels of fine airborne particulate matter.The study, ""Trouble in the Air: Millions of Americans Breathed Polluted Air in 2020,"" used Environmental Protection Agency data to determine that Brownsville-Harlingen in 2020 experienced 129 days of elevated ozone and/or particulate matter. Only two of those days involved elevated ozone levels. As for particulates, the report considers a level of PM2.5 AQI (Air Quality Index) over 50 to be elevated. That translates into over 50 micrograms of particulate matter, less than 2.5 microns in diameter, per cubic feet of air over a 24-hour period.The EPA deems AQI 0-50 to indicate ""good"" air quality, with little to no health risk, and AQI 51-100 ""moderate,"" which can cause respiratory symptoms in ""unusually sensitive individuals."" The Environment Texas report, however, argues that what EPA considers ""safe and acceptable levels of air pollution"" are actually unhealthy in the eyes of ""many American public health groups and international agencies.""Particulate pollution comes from man-made and natural sources, though the smallest particulates (less than PM2.5) are the most dangerous to health and tend to be from man-made sources — especially the burning of fossil fuels as a primary source. The low-air-quality runner-up according to the report was El Paso, with 126 days of elevated ozone and/or particulate matter, 68 days of it attributable to elevated ozone. Ozone can cause lung damage, worsen chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma, and compromise the body's ability to fight off respiratory infections.In a press release, Environment Texas Executive Director Luke Metzger decried as unacceptable the reported 129 days of elevated particulate levels for Brownsville-Harlingen.""Even one day of breathing polluted air has negative consequences for our health,"" he said. ""...We need to do more to deliver cleaner air for our communities.""However, Amit U. Raysoni, an assistant professor with the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley School of Earth, Environmental and Marine Science who studies air pollution, said the Environment Texas report should not be taken to mean that the Lower Valley has the unhealthiest air in Texas. Large metropolises like Houston, San Antonio and El Paso are much worse when it comes to air quality, he said.Raysoni said particulate matter concentration measurements tend to be localized and don't necessarily reflect air quality of an entire city or region. Concentrations vary within an urban area, while central ambient monitoring sites such as the two Brownsville-Harlingen sites the report mentions, ""may not accurately capture the exposure of the whole community,"" he said.Without a major industrial presence or the millions of vehicles of Harris County, the Lower Valley's main contributors to airborne particulates tend to include agricultural and refuse burning, and outdoor grilling and barbecuing, Raysoni said. Other likely factors include long lines of idling trucks at the international bridges and even long-range transport of particulate matter in the form of Saharan dust, he said. Airborne particulates blowing in from Mexico may also play a minor role in the Valley's pollution levels, Raysoni said.Still, by and large ""we're in good shape"" in terms of air quality in the Lower Valley, he said.Meztger said agricultural fires, cross-border traffic, population growth and economic expansion all impact the region's air quality, as likely does Mexico to some degree. Quoting Brownsville's comprehensive plan, he said that ""because PM2.5 is largely caused by the burning of fossil fuels, Brownsville's growing population and industrial activity could pose a future threat to air quality if not property considered and planned for now.""""LNG facilities will certainly worsen air quality,"" Meztger said.Wildfires are a major cause of particulates, and not just in the states where they originate. Metzger noted that Wednesday's TCEQ air quality outlook forecasted that ""light amounts of smoke transported from the ongoing widespread wildfire activity across the Western U.S. and in parts of Montana could raise fine particulate matter across portions of Southeast Texas, along the coastal bend of Texas, and over Deep South Texas."""

A few years back, University of Oklahoma President David Boren realized that OU was ""leaving money on the table"" by not charging students what the government would pay for college. Accordingly, he raised tuition and fees to capture that money.Greg Clift, AnadarkoTake the initiativeRegarding University of Oklahoma President David Boren's ""Become a mentor for your child"" (Opinion, Jan. 24): I agree with Boren and believe it's essential that we choose to look beyond ourselves and try to make a difference in the lives of young people. So many youths today are misguided, confused or for whatever reason making terrible decisions that affect the rest of their lives. Individuals who have a true spirit of giving and desire to make a difference need to stand out and be an example and a role model to the youth of today.Let's do what we can to mold the character of the next generation so they will grow up to make smart decisions in the roles they will fill in their lifetime. Rather than live a self-serving life only to reach our goals, we should take the initiative and be a positive example to the young people of today who will be the decision makers of tomorrow."
